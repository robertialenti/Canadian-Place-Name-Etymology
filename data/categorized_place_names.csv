0,0,Abitibi,"Abitibi: lake in northern Ontario, river flowing into
    Moose River, and also territory in Quebec. Abitibi is an Indian word meaning “half-way water”.
    It is derived from abitah meaning “middle, half-way” and nipi, “water”. The name was originally used by the
    French to designate an obscure band of Algonquin
    Indians living hereabout, half-way between the trading
    posts on Hudson Bay and those on the Ottawa River.",Ontario,Indigenous
1,1,Abinger,"Abinger: township in Addington county, Ontario,
    formed in 1859. It was named in honour of Sir James Scarlett, Baron
    Abinger, of Abinger, in Surrey, England. The family
    was somewhat distinguished for public service. One of
    the Baron’s sons, Sir James Yorke Scarlett, had command
    of the heavy cavalry in the Crimean War, 1854-’56. His
    command made the famous charge at Balaclava, and on
    the same day covered the return of Lord Cardigan’s light
    brigade from its heroic charge. Tennyson made each of
    these bold feats the subject of a glowing, picturesque
    poem.",Ontario,English
2,2,Acadia,"Acadia: name given by the early French settlers to
    the present province of Nova Scotia. The word was used
    also in a loose way to include New Brunswick, Prince
    Edward Island, and the eastern part of Quebec and Maine. The origin of the name is uncertain. Several solutions
    have been put forward but none is approved by all
    archæologists. [2] Some writers derive the name from the Micmac word akade meaning “the place of plenty” or “the inhabited
    place”. Among these are Sir William Dawson and Sir
    John Bourinot. They point to the fact that seventeen
    names in the Maritime Provinces have the termination acade. Vétromile derives the name from the Micmac word academ or tedlacadem meaning “This is our village.” Potter thinks the name a French corruption of the
    Indian word Aquoddiauke which is formed from aquoddie meaning “whiting or cod fish” and auke, “place”, “the
    home of the cod fish”. Others derive the name from La Cadie in France.
    There is still a village called Lacadee, near D’Orthez,
    lower Pyrenees, France. This may be the correct derivation.
    Emigrants are partial to the name left behind and
    set to work with lighter heart to create a namesake on
    new shores. The name is preserved in Acadia College, a flourishing
    Baptist institution, at Wolfville, Nova Scotia.",Nova Scotia,Indigenous

    no doubt suggested by his son, Viscount Bury, afterwards
    seventh Earl of Albemarle, when he was Superintendent
    of Indian Affairs in Canada, 1854-’56. He negotiated a[4] treaty that opened up the Saugeen reserve for settlement.

    Aldborough was the birthplace of Rev. George Crabbe,
    1754-1832, a poet of distinction at this time. The Aldborough

    generally held to be derived from the Indian word Algonquin, spelled Al-gom-me-quin by Champlain in 1632.
    An official aboriginal map of 1857 shows the whole of this
    district to have been Algonquin territory. Mr. Hugh Ray
    of the Legislative Library, Toronto, an Algonquin scholar,

    Manitoulin Island. [6]",Ontario,Indigenous
17,17,Algona,"Algona: township in Renfrew county, Ontario, formed

    streams. The forests are alive with deer, moose, beaver
    and wild fowl of many kinds. The lakes and streams
    abound in shining fish. Algonquin is paradise for the
    wildings of the wood. The Park took its name from the Algonquins who
    excelled most of the Indian tribes in arts and other attainments.
    By the Iroquois they were called Adirondacks,
    that is “bark-eaters”, in derision. In sober Indian they
    were called Odis qua gume, that is “people at the end of
    the water”. They are supposed to have been at the head
    of a northern confederacy and to have descended the
    Ottawa at the close of the 10th century and to have
    occupied the left bank of the St. Lawrence. This family
    of Indians received the generic name Algonquins from the
    French, formerly thought to have been contracted from Algomequin, meaning “those on the other side”, but now
    generally believed to be derived from the Micmac Algoo-making,
    meaning “at the place of spearing fish”.",Ontario,Indigenous

    a Mr. Meek suggested Alton. He had been reading
    of Alton in Illinois, a place resembling the Canadian
    situation in many respects. [9] The city of Alton, Illinois, is on a high limestone bluff,
    somewhat hilly, 200 feet above the waters of the Mississippi

30,30,America,"America: Canada of to-day and Newfoundland were
    known generally as British America from 1763 to 1867,

    of Amerigo Vespucci (latinized form Americus Vespucius)
    who sailed westward on an expedition of explor[10]ation,
    according to his own account, in 1497 and on June
    6th of that year reached the coast of what is now known
    as Dutch Guiana in South America. During the next
    four years Amerigo made two more voyages, reaching
    the coast of Brazil. On his return he published an
    account of what he had seen, the first printed description
    of the mainland of the Western Hemisphere. A German professor of Geography, named Waldseemuller,
    teaching in St. Die College,[1] read Amerigo Vespucci’s
    account and in 1507 he printed a little book in
    Latin entitled An Introduction to Geography. In this
    work occurred this sentence, “And the fourth part of the
    world having been discovered by Amerigo or Americus,
    we may call it Amerige or America”. This pamphlet on
    geography made its way into the schools of Western
    Europe and the schoolmaster’s newly-coined word was
    permanently stamped on the Western Hemisphere. Whether Amerigo Vespucci is entitled to the honour
    or not, no man has such a monument as he, for his name
    is written across the map of two continents. If he saw
    the coast of the main land on June 6th, 1497, he discovered
    America eighteen days before John Cabot, who
    reached it on June 24th of that year, and more than a
    year before Columbus saw the mainland, third voyage,
    August 1, 1498. Many historians, however, dispute

121,121,Birtle,"Birtle: county and town in Manitoba, about 200 miles
    north-west of Winnipeg. The town was founded in 1880. The word Birtle is a contraction of Birdtail, the name
    of a river running through the town. In former days this
    stream was much frequented by wild birds and the
    Indians gathered along its shores feathers suitable for
    making their head dresses, hence the name.",Manitoba,Indigenous

    in 1878. Its origin is uncertain. It has been suggested that it
    was named after the Hon. Timothy Blair Pardee who was
    Commissioner of Crown Lands, 1873-’88. Others think it
    was named in honour of Hon. Adam Johnson Fergusson
    Blair who was Receiver-General and Provincial Secretary

    of Marlborough—Marquis of Blandford. Since 1702 this
    title has been borne by the eldest son of the Duke. The
    title was taken from the town of Blandford in Dorsetshire.
    The name occurs in Doomsday Book. The fortunes of the Marlborough family were founded
    by John Churchill. History awards him great military
    talents but unscrupulous character. Queen Anne conferred

125,125,Blanshard,"Blanshard: township in Perth county, Ontario, formed
    in 1831. It was named in honour of Richard Blanshard, a director

    British capitalists, formed in 1825 by John Galt, bought
    at a nominal sum two and a half million acres of wild

    England, the estate bestowed on John Churchill, Duke

    Bavarians at Blenheim in 1704. Half a million sterling
    was voted by parliament to erect a castle for the family

    state it is Portuguese. The Indian name for this wondrous
    Cape was Plekteok, meaning “a hand spike”, descriptive
    of its shape. Navigators of former days were
    fond of speaking of it by the name of Blow-me-down. Many writers, inspired by the scene, have told the

    Head, Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada, 1836-’38. It
    was suggested by Joel Flesher Robinson, first Postmaster
    of the place and an ardent admirer of the Governor. Sir Francis took up the reins of administration in
    Upper Canada when political discord was at its height.
    He was an opponent of responsible government and so
    lost the sympathy of a large section of the people of the

    account of its connection with Sir John Franklin’s expedition
    in which all hands perished after discovering the[35] North-west Passage. It is of scientific importance, too,

    England, from which the name may have been taken.
    However, a post office was opened at McCabe’s Landing

    are named after Joseph Brant (Thayendanaga),
    the Mohawk chief, 1742-1807, leader of the Six Nation
    Indians. They were accustomed to cross the Grand River
    in the vicinity of the site of the present city, hence
    Brant’s ford, now written, Brantford. Brant was an ally
    of the English in the revolutionary war of 1775-’83. For
    his services he was granted for his people a territory on
    the Grand River, six miles in width from its source to its
    mouth. He was a Christian and greatly respected by all.
    Brant translated the Gospel of St. Mark into the Mohawk
    language. Mohawk is an Algonquin word and means “cannibal”.
    It was applied to this Iroquois tribe by their enemies.
    The name by which the Mohawks called themselves was
    Caniengas, i.e., “People-at-the-Flint”. Vide The Iroquois

    of gold”, or water, descriptive of the configuration of the
    shore or of the mines of the precious metal which the
    early explorers supposed it to contain. Other authorities
    give Le Lac de Labrador, meaning “the lake of the
    labourer”. This name is found on early maps and it is the
    more likely origin. It is said that the early Spanish and[38] Portuguese navigators carried off the natives of these

    because of its long beach extending into Lake Ontario.
    The word Brighton is an abbreviation of Brighthelmstone,

147,147,British Columbia,"British Columbia: province of Canada, so named in

    of latitude, and the main ridge of the Rocky Mountains
    on the east, and the Pacific Ocean on the west, was called
    New Caledonia. A few years before Confederation
    (1867), Vancouver Island was annexed to the mainland
    by act of the Imperial Parliament, and the united colonies
    became the province of British Columbia on the suggestion
    of Queen Victoria to whom an appeal for a name
    had been made. New Caledonia was discarded because
    it was borne by a colony or island in the south Pacific

    Brockville, Leeds county, Ontario, are named in honour[39] of Major-General Sir Isaac Brock who fell in defence of
    Canada at Queenston, October 13, 1812. For his brilliant capture of Detroit on August 16th
    of the same year King George III. knighted Brock, but he
    was in his grave before the news reached Canada. The
    King took a novel way of informing the Hero of Upper
    Canada of the honour conferred on him. He sent him a
    very large and beautifully executed gold medal, made to
    suspend from the neck. On the obverse is “Detroit”
    exquisitely engraved; on the reverse, the figure of Britannia,
    and round the rim “Major-General Sir Isaac
    Brock”. In the summer of 1913, when the writer saw
    this medal it was in the possession of the Misses Tupper
    of Guernsey, great-nieces of Sir Isaac. Isaac Brock was the eighth son of John Brock, Esq.,
    who had a family of ten sons and four daughters. He
    was born on October 6th, 1769, in the parish of St. Peter
    Port, Guernsey—the year which gave birth to Wellington
    and Napoleon. The old home of the family is still standing,
    a large, well-constructed brick house, but one hundred
    years after the battle of Queenston not one descendant
    of the surname Brock was living. The boy Brock chose the military profession for his
    career and became an ensign in the King’s Regiment in
    his sixteenth year. Promotion followed promotion until
    he became a Major-General on the 4th of June, 1811.
    Canada holds him in the highest esteem not only as an
    able and meritorious officer but as a man of the finest
    moral fibre. In acknowledgment of the inestimable services of Sir
    Isaac the Imperial Parliament granted the family 12,000
    acres of land, largely in Oxford county, Ontario, and a
    pension of £200 a year for life to each of his surviving
    brothers. [40] Several monuments have been erected in Canada in
    Sir Isaac Brock’s memory, the most impressive of which
    stands on Queenston Heights near the spot where he fell.

    accords Lord Elgin great tact and wisdom. The Bruce family is of Norman origin. After the
    battle of Hastings, 1066, William the Norman Conqueror

186,186,Canada.,"Canada. The derivation generally accepted of our
    country’s name is the Iroquois word Kanata or Kanada,
    meaning “a cabin, a lodge”. The name made its first
    recorded appearance in Cartier’s account of his second
    voyage in 1535. The native Gaspé guides that he took
    on board before entering the unknown river informed[51] him that the country thereabout was divided into three
    sections; namely, the Saguenay territory extending from
    the Isle of Anticosti to the Isle Aux Coudres; next Canada
    extending from Coudres to Hochelaga, and the last territory,
    beyond Hochelaga, they reported richest and best
    of all. The name Canada was used by Cartier’s Indian
    guides to describe the territory where there were clusters
    of cabins, the section in which the natives had constructed
    somewhat permanent homes. If the Iroquois word be accepted as the correct derivation,
    therein lies a mystery. The earliest records of Canada
    state the Algonquins occupied all the country from
    the Atlantic seaboard to Lake Ontario. The Algonquin
    word for a settlement is Odanah. Is our spelling of
    Canada a corruption of this word? On the other hand
    Cartier used other Iroquois words in his account of the
    voyage. It may be that the Iroquois occupied the Lower
    St. Lawrence in common with the Algonquins at a still
    earlier period and left traces of their language behind. R. P. Arnaud, Indian scholar, states the word Canada
    is derived from a Montagnais idiom signifying étranger (French), that is “foreign parts”, “unknown country”.
    The Montagnais dwelt in the Saguenay district. In his geography published in 1760 Thomas Jefferys
    has given the meaning, can “the country” and ada,
    “mouth”, “the mouth of the country”, in allusion to the
    great river called ‘Canada’ by some early writers, now the
    St. Lawrence. Some trace the words Canada and canyon or cañon to
    the same Spanish origin, caña, “a reed”, of which cañada
    is a derivative and cañon an augmentative, meaning “the
    beautiful glen or vale”, the beaupré of the French, descriptive
    of much of the St. Lawrence valley. [52] There is a tradition that the name originated with
    Spanish explorers who failed to find gold mines here and
    described the country by the Spanish phrase, Aca nada, aca meaning “here”, and nada, “nothing”. Katharine Livingstone Macpherson of Montreal has
    embalmed this traditional origin in a poem, the first

    from the French government in 1670. Apparently by an
    error in transcription Carrion became Carillon. Carillon, a French word (pronounced car-i-yon)
    means “musical bells”. A carillon is not, however, just

    French General in the Great War, 1914-’18, and Generalissimo
    of the allied forces, 1918-’19. He died at the age
    of seventy-seven years in March, 1929, and was buried
    near the tomb of Napoleon I. in the Invalides, Paris. The most classic despatch (reputed) of the Great War
    has been credited to him while engaged at the first battle
    of the Marne. It was said General Foch reported to his
    superior officer, Marshal Joffre, in these words: “My
    right is crushed. My left is in retreat. I am attacking
    with my centre.” The story has had several variations,
    the most important of which is: “Pressed on my right
    wing, with my centre broken, I am attacking with my
    left. My situation is excellent.” General Foch (Marshal in 1918) held that offence
    was the best method of defence and an utterance of the[107] foregoing nature would accord well with his theory but
    the Encyclopædia Britannica states that the story is a
    legend and President Poincaré made a similar remark
    when welcoming the immortal Marshal to the French
    Academy in 1920. The story persisted in finding credence,
    however, and gained popular prestige for Foch at an
    opportune time.",Alberta,French

    in the first instance to the entrance of the bay. However
    this French phrase might be translated “deep bay”. On

    1600, a French soldier, seeing a party of Indians
    (Wyandottes) with their hair cropped and silver-coloured,
    dubbed them “Hurons”. This word is derived from
    the French hure meaning bristly. The manner in
    which they dressed their hair suggested the bristles of
    the wild boar. The Wyandottes or Hurons at first occupied the northern
    shores of the St. Lawrence westward from Montreal
    and afterwards the country between Lake Simcoe and

514,514,Iroquois,"Iroquois: town in Dundas county, Ontario. It took its name from one of the principal Indian
    tribes of North America, called by the French “Iroquois”
    and by the British the Six Nations. The Iroquois Confederacy
    was composed of the Mohawks, Oneidas, Onondagas,
    Senecas, Cayugas and Tuscaroras. It was formed
    about 1540 for mutual protection, and was successfully
    maintained for 200 years. The union was never formally
    dissolved. The Indian name of this league was Ho-de-no-saw-nee,
    or “People of the Long House”. It is said the
    structure of this league suggested the union of the thirteen
    English colonies in the Revolutionary War of 1776-’83—a
    union which developed into the United States of
    America. The origin of the Iroquois is obscure. Most authorities
    state this tribe came originally from the vicinity of
    Hudson Bay by way of the Ottawa and Saguenay in the
    days long agone, as a small nation, and settled along the
    north shore of the St. Lawrence, from Hochelaga to
    Stadacona, among the Hurons and Algonquins, from
    whom they learned the arts of husbandry and the tactics
    of war. Becoming numerous they rose against their[142] masters but were compelled to seek fresh fields and
    settled in the district now known as the State of New
    York. Charlevoix derives the word Iroquois from hiro, “I
    have spoken”, and koue which when long drawn out is a
    cry of sorrow and when briefly uttered an exclamation
    of joy. With these words, according to Charlevoix, the
    orators of this tribe were in the habit of closing all their
    public speeches. Horatio Hale objects to the French compound and
    states that the term Iroquois is a modification of Ierokwa,
    meaning, “They who smoke” or briefly the “Tobacco
    People”. Dr. Benjamin Suite of Ottawa states that an Iroquois
    chief at Caughnawaga near Montreal told him Iro was not
    used at the close of an address but was a salutation on
    entering a room where there was company and that it
    meant, “here”, “here I am”.",Ontario,Indigenous

    the water and the land of this locality during the American

    visited on this occasion are borne by the two counties of
    the island of Montreal. The river known as Jacques Cartier was visited by
    Champlain in 1603 and so named by him under the impression
    that the Admiral and his company of three ships

554,554,Labrador,"Labrador: coast district on the north-east boundary
    of Quebec Province, forming a dependency of Newfoundland. Authors do not agree as to the exact meaning or
    origin of the word Labrador. Gosling in his History of
    Labrador states that in 1501 Henry VII. gave letters
    patent granting certain privileges in the New World to
    three merchants of Bristol and three farmers or labourers
    from the Azores by name Gonzales and the two Fernandez.
    On the voyage out Juan Fernandez was the first to
    sight this land and the sailors dubbed it Lavrador or
    Labrador, the Portuguese word for labour. Dr. N. E. Dionne in his book La Nouvelle France de
    Cartier à Champlain is inclined to think that the Spaniards
    and even the Portuguese may have translated Terre
    de Labour, primitively given by the Basques to this part
    of their discoveries, by the word Labrador. Labour is a
    small territory in southern France, situated between
    Gascony and the Basque country. Kingsford in his History of Canada says that the
    word is a corruption of Laboratores terrae, so called because
    in the year 1500 Cortereal seized a cargo of fifty
    natives and sold them in Europe for slaves. Other writers derive the word from the Spanish
    phrase, Tierra Labrador, “the farmers’ or labourer’s
    land”, it being less barren than Greenland. Monseigneur
    Charles Gway in an article published in 1903 agrees with
    this derivation but states that it is evident the name was
    given in derision to this tract of waste land. Another origin that has been suggested is the French
    phrase le bras d’or, “the arm of gold”. Most early explorers
    were in quest of the precious metal and the natives
    informed those who gave the name that their land[157] abounded in the golden ore. If this be the origin, the
    name has so far proved a misnomer. As recently as 1924
    discovery of rich gold mines was reported, but prospectors

    Its history dates from 1797, when Nathan Hayard
    Treadwell erected a mill here. The village took its name from L’Orignal Point which

    bomb-proof casemates of the King’s bastion remained.
    Over the grass-grown ground, where formerly stood a
    great fortress and a busy town, a flock of sheep was
    quietly grazing. A granite shaft on the site of the Dauphin’s
    Gate of the fort, erected by citizens of the U.S.,
    the Society of Colonial Wars in America, in 1895, commemorates
    the first capture of Louisbourg by Sir William

    The La Vérendryes, father and son, discovered this lake

    or beautiful water”, and was used by the aboriginals

    The town is situated on the River Douver still correctly

823,823,Port Hope,"Port Hope: picturesque and progressive town in
    Durham county, Ontario. The first white settler on the site of the town was one
    Peter Smith, a trader and hunter, who established himself
    here about 1778. An Indian village in the locality
    was called Cochingomink and Smith built his cabin on a
    creek which ran through it. In process of time both the
    creek and settlement became known as Smith’s Creek. By 1792 U.E. Loyalists began to arrive, and take up
    farms, Mr. Myndert Harris and family pioneering the
    way. In 1815 Jeremiah Britton opened up the first store.
    Smith’s Creek soon fell into disuse and Toronto was[229] substituted therefor. But when a post office was opened
    in 1817 the duality of names gave rise to confusion. In
    1819 a public meeting was called and G. S. Bolton, a
    resident, suggested Port Hope, which was unanimously
    adopted. No one seems to know why Hope was made the choice
    of the residents, no record of the meeting bearing on this
    point having come to light. However, in all probability
    it was named in honour of Colonel Henry Hope, Lieutenant-Governor
    of Canada from 1785 to his death in 1789.
    He was a true friend to all the people of Canada and was
    particularly careful in considering the fortunes of the new
    Loyalist settlers on the banks of the St. Lawrence River
    and Lake Ontario, of which there were 1,800. The
    Government had undertaken to furnish provisions only
    until May, 1786. Pointing out that destitution would
    arise, Hope had the period extended until the crops were
    harvested. He had a Commission appointed also to
    investigate and adjust all Loyalist claims. It is not at all
    likely that the U.E. Loyalists were unmindful of his
    vital services. As a mark of respect the citizens of Quebec City called
    the gate finished in 1784, leading from the upper town to
    the ramp descending to Saint Roch suburb, after him. At
    this time it was first known as “Hope Gate” which name it

    1796. The family is descended from the Dutch friend of[230] King William III., William Bentinck, who sought to save
    the Prince’s life by lying in bed with him when he had the
    smallpox. When William of Orange became King of
    England he showered estates and honours on Bentinck. The title was taken from the Isle of Portland in

    name may have been suggested by, the ferocity of the

    by which the Canadian Pacific Railway crosses the
    Selkirks. When Van Horne took hold of the C.P.R. in 1882, its

    several minor places in Canada. Selkirk was a member of the Douglas family and his
    patriotic feelings were aroused by the condition of the
    humbler classes of the Highlands. His remedy was emigration.
    He bought £40,000 of the £100,000 stock of the
    Hudson’s Bay Company and this, with the stock held by
    friends, secured Selkirk a controlling interest in the Company.
    He then asked and secured from the directors
    160,000 square miles of territory in Manitoba on certain
    conditions of settlement. In 1811 about ninety persons
    from Scotland and Ireland reached York Factory, Hudson
    Bay, where they wintered, and in the spring of 1812 continued
    their journey, arriving at Red River in August of
    that year. This date marks the commencement of the

    the Great Lakes. Seneca is said to be a corruption of Sonontowane meaning “great mountain”. It may be of
    Algonquin origin from their word sinako meaning

    first discoverers of this metal were the German miners
    of old. Its hardness and the difficulty they experienced[276] in smelting it led them to associate the metal with “Old

    charming town near Windsor, Essex county, Ontario. The Indians did not give their children permanent
    names in infancy. They waited until the youth or maiden
    manifested dominant qualities or characteristics and then
    gave a name in keeping therewith. Te-cum-seh is said to

    bravest and most humane soldier, the wisest counsellor,

    killing of captives and prisoners. His conception and[280] formation of a union or confederacy of all the Indian
    tribes to protect themselves against the encroachments
    of the whites is without a parallel. Tecumseh’s speeches

    from Cree Indian, opasquiaow, “water converging to a
    narrows with high land and spruce trees on either side”. Others think the term is French, Le Pas, meaning “the
    gateway” or “narrow passage” leading to the northland. The younger Verendryes discovered the Saskatchewan

    the river flows. On the west side of the river a narrow
    point juts out for one-half mile, and as this is approached
    by water from east or west it looks as though it were
    leaning over the water, and the Jesuit Fathers named it

        Superior and after passing Thunder Cape (which is over twelve
        hundred feet high), and getting into Thunder Bay, we had a
        thunder storm which for grandeur I never expect to see surpassed—the
        vivid flashes of lightning lighting up the mountains on each
        side of us and showing the black waves with their white caps
        around us on every side; then from all sides of us ribbons of fire
        ran up the sky in all shapes, more like rockets and fireworks, whilst
        the thunder leaped from mountain to mountain in a continued roar,
        like nothing I ever heard before, and followed by a low growl.
        The lightning I suppose is attracted by the mineral deposits all
        around Thunder Bay. Certainly the whole locality is well named.
        If I were an artist I would choose Thunder Bay in a storm as the
        grandest representation of the end of the world. I could not help
        fancying when I looked over the side of the vessel that I would see
        old Charon launch his boat from the foot of Thunder Cape. Thunder

    the Ontario Archaeological Report of 1899, holds that the
    foregoing derivations are erroneous. He thinks the word
    is a contraction of a compound formed from Seneca Kanitare, “lake”, and onto, “to open”, that is the opening
    or gateway from Lake Ontario to the country of the
    Hurons. Toronto Bay was but the entrance to the route
    which continued by Toronto River (now Humber) and
    Lake Toronto (now Simcoe). See copy of a French map
    of 1680 in Lizars’ The Story of the Humber, the original
    of which is in the Quebec Seminary. Dr. Scadding in his Toronto of Old derives the word
    Toronto from the Huron language with the meaning of
    “much, many”. It was their name for the meeting-place,
    the populous region of native tribes, bordering on Lake
    Simcoe. The name became attached to the landing-place[287] of parties on the shore of Ontario who were on their way
    to the Huron country to hunt or trade, the starting place
    gradually taking the name of the goal. Some writers maintain Toronto means “a place of
    plenty”, a signification allied to that given by Dr.
    Scadding. They state the Hurons applied the term from
    which Toronto is derived to any body of water where
    ducks and fish were plentiful. Another signification is “trees-rising-out-of-the-water”,
    willows on The Island sighted from canoes, which
    seems to be mere guesswork from a Mohawk word of
    fancied resemblance.",Ontario,Indigenous

    by an elderly squaw and so besmeared by dirt that it took
    all the water of the lake to purify him, and by way of
    retaliation he has ever since busied himself keeping up the
    discoloration. Fort Garry, a trading post of the Hudson’s Bay Company,

    a direct descendant of the brave general, in the
    presence of a distinguished gathering of the Empire’s
    sons. Thus did the marquis of to-day show his appreciation
    of the illustrious opponent of his heroic ancestor.
    This statue of the general was the gift of Canada and was
    designed by the famous Canadian sculptor, Dr. Tait
