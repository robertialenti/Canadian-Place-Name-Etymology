    Peel county, Ontario, organized in 1806, and of Toronto
    Gore township in the same county, formed in 1819. [286] The city of Toronto was founded in 1793 by Lieut.-Governor
    Simcoe of Upper Canada under the name of
    York. This name was given in honour of Frederick, Duke
    of York, second son of King George III., who was commander
    of a British army that won a victory in conjunction
    with the Austrians in this year over the French
    armies in Flanders. When York was incorporated as a
    city in 1834 its name was changed to Toronto. The word Toronto is stated by nearly all authorities
    to be of Iroquois Indian origin but its meaning is disputed. Dr. Hough, an Indian scholar of the United States,
    derives the word from Iroquois Thoron-to-hen, meaning
    “timber (fallen trees) in the water”. Dr. L. H. Morgan, an American student of the Iroquois
    language, traces Toronto to De-on-do which he translates
    by “logs floating on the water”; a common sight, doubtless,
    on the bay before the advent of the whites. General John S. Clark of Auburn, N.Y., who
    contributed an exhaustive study of the word Toronto to
    the Ontario Archaeological Report of 1899, holds that the
    foregoing derivations are erroneous. He thinks the word
    is a contraction of a compound formed from Seneca Kanitare, “lake”, and onto, “to open”, that is the opening
    or gateway from Lake Ontario to the country of the
    Hurons. Toronto Bay was but the entrance to the route
    which continued by Toronto River (now Humber) and
    Lake Toronto (now Simcoe). See copy of a French map
    of 1680 in Lizars’ The Story of the Humber, the original
    of which is in the Quebec Seminary. Dr. Scadding in his Toronto of Old derives the word
    Toronto from the Huron language with the meaning of
    “much, many”. It was their name for the meeting-place,
    the populous region of native tribes, bordering on Lake
    Simcoe. The name became attached to the landing-place[287] of parties on the shore of Ontario who were on their way
    to the Huron country to hunt or trade, the starting place
    gradually taking the name of the goal. Some writers maintain Toronto means “a place of
    plenty”, a signification allied to that given by Dr.
    Scadding. They state the Hurons applied the term from
    which Toronto is derived to any body of water where
    ducks and fish were plentiful. Another signification is “trees-rising-out-of-the-water”,
    willows on The Island sighted from canoes, which
    seems to be mere guesswork from a Mohawk word of

It took its name from one of the principal Indian
    tribes of North America, called by the French “Iroquois”
    and by the British the Six Nations. The Iroquois Confederacy
    was composed of the Mohawks, Oneidas, Onondagas,
    Senecas, Cayugas and Tuscaroras. It was formed
    about 1540 for mutual protection, and was successfully
    maintained for 200 years. The union was never formally
    dissolved. The Indian name of this league was Ho-de-no-saw-nee,
    or “People of the Long House”. It is said the
    structure of this league suggested the union of the thirteen
    English colonies in the Revolutionary War of 1776-’83—a
    union which developed into the United States of
    America. The origin of the Iroquois is obscure. Most authorities
    state this tribe came originally from the vicinity of
    Hudson Bay by way of the Ottawa and Saguenay in the
    days long agone, as a small nation, and settled along the
    north shore of the St. Lawrence, from Hochelaga to
    Stadacona, among the Hurons and Algonquins, from
    whom they learned the arts of husbandry and the tactics
    of war. Becoming numerous they rose against their[142] masters but were compelled to seek fresh fields and
    settled in the district now known as the State of New
    York. Charlevoix derives the word Iroquois from hiro, “I
    have spoken”, and koue which when long drawn out is a
    cry of sorrow and when briefly uttered an exclamation
    of joy. With these words, according to Charlevoix, the
    orators of this tribe were in the habit of closing all their
    public speeches. Horatio Hale objects to the French compound and
    states that the term Iroquois is a modification of Ierokwa,
    meaning, “They who smoke” or briefly the “Tobacco
    People”. Dr. Benjamin Suite of Ottawa states that an Iroquois
    chief at Caughnawaga near Montreal told him Iro was not
    used at the close of an address but was a salutation on
    entering a room where there was company and that it
    meant, “here”, “here I am”.",Indigenous,exact,Armstrong (1930)

    was called Cochingomink and Smith built his cabin on a
    creek which ran through it. In process of time both the
    creek and settlement became known as Smith’s Creek. By 1792 U.E. Loyalists began to arrive, and take up
    farms, Mr. Myndert Harris and family pioneering the
    way. In 1815 Jeremiah Britton opened up the first store.
    Smith’s Creek soon fell into disuse and Toronto was[229] substituted therefor. But when a post office was opened
    in 1817 the duality of names gave rise to confusion. In
    1819 a public meeting was called and G. S. Bolton, a
    resident, suggested Port Hope, which was unanimously
    adopted. No one seems to know why Hope was made the choice
    of the residents, no record of the meeting bearing on this
    point having come to light. However, in all probability
    it was named in honour of Colonel Henry Hope, Lieutenant-Governor
    of Canada from 1785 to his death in 1789.

    and Lake Ontario, of which there were 1,800. The
    Government had undertaken to furnish provisions only
    until May, 1786. Pointing out that destitution would
    arise, Hope had the period extended until the crops were
    harvested. He had a Commission appointed also to
    investigate and adjust all Loyalist claims. It is not at all
    likely that the U.E. Loyalists were unmindful of his
    vital services. As a mark of respect the citizens of Quebec City called
    the gate finished in 1784, leading from the upper town to

    gave a name in keeping therewith. Te-cum-seh is said to

    killing of captives and prisoners. His conception and[280] formation of a union or confederacy of all the Indian
    tribes to protect themselves against the encroachments
    of the whites is without a parallel. Tecumseh’s speeches
