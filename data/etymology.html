<h2>PREFACE</h2>
<p>Every place-name is a challenge to one&rsquo;s natural
    curiosity, a stimulus to enquiry which merits both
    commendation and explanation. This instinctive
    quality of the mind is a vital factor in its education.</p>
<p>A place-name is never a mere arbitrary or meaningless
    sound. It embodies a chapter in the story of the place to
    which it is attached. There is many a colourful name,
    rich in historic associations, on the map of Canada.</p>
<p>The study of place-names is, therefore, a valuable side-light
    on history. The direct method of seeking information
    in written records yields often but scanty returns or
    in some cases none at all. The Indian nations of Canada
    have left us no recorded evidence on important points,
    place-names and a few mounds alone afford us most of our
    knowledge of their life in its manifold forms.</p>
<p>Modern educationists make much use of place-names in
    arousing interest in local history&mdash;the scientific starting-point
    for the more extensive study of the subject&mdash;among
    their pupils. A thorough study of the origin of the names
    of places in their own township or county is made
    under the guidance of the teacher and the findings given
    to the local newspaper. Errors and omissions are
    pointed out by correspondents and interesting details
    brought to light. Thus are history and geography
    correlated, training of much value in investigation is
    afforded, and besides, a stimulus is given to patriotism.</p>
<p>The history of the development of place nomenclature
    in Canada falls into five main periods corresponding
    roughly with the general history of the country, revealing
    racial modes of thought and taste:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span></p>
<p>1. There is the Indian period which gives us so many
    of our melodious and strikingly appropriate names descriptive
    of some physical feature or commemorative of
    some notable event; as, Winnipeg, Niagara, Restigouche.
    In this connection it must never be forgotten that the
    Indians, like all primitive peoples, had no proper names,
    all of a class were described by the same word or phrase.
    It was the work of the white settlers to detach the Indian
    term from all but one locality and make it the name of a
    particular place in order to facilitate their business activities.</p>
<p>2. The period of exploration when Portuguese,
    Spanish and French navigators contributed expressive
    terms to our nomenclature; as Fundy, Bras d&rsquo;or, Chaleur.</p>
<p>3. The French period which discloses the religious
    nature of the people and their appreciation of their
    leaders, as, St. Laurent, St. Anne, St. Marie, Louisburg,
    Frontenac.</p>
<p>4. The British Loyalist period which is marked by the
    deep attachment of settlers, from Great Britain and Ireland
    and from the United States immediately after the
    Revolution of 1783, to the Royal family, by their esteem
    for the Kingdom&rsquo;s prominent statesmen, soldiers and
    sailors, and by their love for the place-names of the home
    they had left; as, Charlottetown, York, Wellington,
    Lincoln, London.</p>
<p>5. The modern or national period in which the Canadian
    born choose their place-names largely from the land
    of their birth, often in memory of the red man, oftener
    in commemoration of their captains of industry or
    statesmen and law-givers, not forgetting on occasion
    imperial benefactors; as, Saskatchewan, Okanagan,
    Fernie, Timmins, Haliburton, Kitchener.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span></p>
<p>On the whole Canada&rsquo;s nomenclature is varied and
    attractive. It contains words from five languages and
    commemorates great movements and the names of many
    persons notable in our country&rsquo;s development. The past
    of a country is embalmed in its place-names and literature.
    They are its enduring monuments.</p>
<p>In so great a field this volume is necessarily but a
    representative contribution. While a considerable part
    of the information has been gathered at first-hand, a still
    greater part has been derived from recorded sources
    ordinarily inaccessible, so many that it is quite impossible
    to give individual credit here to all. The names of many
    authors and correspondents are given in the text. Every
    other debt is hereby gratefully acknowledged.</p>

<h2>THE ORIGIN AND MEANING OF
    PLACE NAMES IN CANADA</h2>
<hr class="chap" />
<h2>A</h2>
<p><span class="bold">Abitibi</span>: lake in northern Ontario, river flowing into
    Moose River, and also territory in Quebec.</p>
<p>Abitibi is an Indian word meaning &ldquo;half-way water&rdquo;.
    It is derived from <i>abitah</i> meaning &ldquo;middle, half-way&rdquo; and <i>nipi</i>, &ldquo;water&rdquo;. The name was originally used by the
    French to designate an obscure band of Algonquin
    Indians living hereabout, <i>half-way</i> between the trading
    posts on Hudson Bay and those on the Ottawa River.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Abinger</span>: township in Addington county, Ontario,
    formed in 1859.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Sir James Scarlett, Baron
    Abinger, of Abinger, in Surrey, England. The family
    was somewhat distinguished for public service. One of
    the Baron&rsquo;s sons, Sir James Yorke Scarlett, had command
    of the heavy cavalry in the Crimean War, 1854-&rsquo;56. His
    command made the famous charge at Balaclava, and on
    the same day covered the return of Lord Cardigan&rsquo;s light
    brigade from its heroic charge. Tennyson made each of
    these bold feats the subject of a glowing, picturesque
    poem.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Acadia</span>: name given by the early French settlers to
    the present province of Nova Scotia. The word was used
    also in a loose way to include New Brunswick, Prince
    Edward Island, and the eastern part of Quebec and Maine.</p>
<p>The origin of the name is uncertain. Several solutions
    have been put forward but none is approved by all
    archæologists.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>
<p>Some writers derive the name from the Micmac word <i>akade</i> meaning &ldquo;the place of plenty&rdquo; or &ldquo;the inhabited
    place&rdquo;. Among these are Sir William Dawson and Sir
    John Bourinot. They point to the fact that seventeen
    names in the Maritime Provinces have the termination <i>acade</i>.</p>
<p>Vétromile derives the name from the Micmac word <i>academ</i> or <i>tedlacadem</i> meaning &ldquo;This is our village.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Potter thinks the name a French corruption of the
    Indian word <i>Aquoddiauke</i> which is formed from <i>aquoddie</i> meaning &ldquo;whiting or cod fish&rdquo; and <i>auke</i>, &ldquo;place&rdquo;, &ldquo;the
    home of the cod fish&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Others derive the name from La Cadie in France.
    There is still a village called Lacadee, near D&rsquo;Orthez,
    lower Pyrenees, France. This may be the correct derivation.
    Emigrants are partial to the name left behind and
    set to work with lighter heart to create a namesake on
    new shores.</p>
<p>The name is preserved in Acadia College, a flourishing
    Baptist institution, at Wolfville, Nova Scotia.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Addington</span>: county in Ontario.</p>
<p>It was named in 1792 after Henry Addington, Lord
    Sidmouth, who was speaker of the British House of
    Commons from 1789 to 1801, and afterwards Prime
    Minister of the Empire. He was a favourite of King
    George III. Doubtless the county was named by Lieut.-Governor
    Simcoe in honour of his friend.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Adelaide</span>: township in Middlesex county, Ontario, was
    formed in 1830.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Amelia Adelaide Louisa
    Theresa Caroline, eldest daughter of George, Duke of
    Saxe-Coburg-Meiningen, and wife of King William IV.
    of England.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Adjala</span>: township in Simcoe county, Ontario, formed
    in 1822.</p>
<p>The origin of the word is uncertain. Tradition gives
    Adjala as the name of a daughter of Tecumseh. On the
    other hand Tecumseh&rsquo;s biographers state he had no
    daughter, and only one son, Pugeshashenwa, &ldquo;crouching
    panther&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Admaston</span>: township in Renfrew county, Ontario. It
    was erected into a separate municipality in 1843.</p>
<p>The township was named in honour of Admaston
    village in Stafford county, England.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Adolphustown</span>: township in Lennox county formed in
    1784.</p>
<p>It was named after Prince Adolphus Frederick, Duke
    of Cambridge, seventh son of King George III. His son,
    Prince George, Duke of Cambridge, became Commander-in-Chief
    of the armies of the Empire. Queen Mary, wife
    of George V., is the great-grand-daughter of Prince
    Adolphus.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Airy</span>: township in Nipissing, Ontario, formed in 1872.</p>
<p>It was named after Sir George Biddell Airy, an eminent
    British scientist, Astronomer Royal, 1835-&rsquo;81. He
    discovered the optical disorder called Astigmatism and
    furnished a remedy for it.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Albemarle</span>: township in Bruce county, Ontario,
    formed in 1855.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of General George Thomas
    Keppel, sixth Earl of Albemarle, who fought with distinction
    at Waterloo with the 14th regiment. The name was
    no doubt suggested by his son, Viscount Bury, afterwards
    seventh Earl of Albemarle, when he was Superintendent
    of Indian Affairs in Canada, 1854-&rsquo;56. He negotiated a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span> treaty that opened up the Saugeen reserve for settlement.
    The first Earldom of Albemarle was conferred by King
    William III. and takes its name from a town and territory
    in Normandy.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Alberni</span>: city in British Columbia.</p>
<p>It takes its name from the Alberni Canal, named in
    1791, after Pedro Alberni, Commander of the military
    force under Lieut. Francisco Eliza sent by the Viceroy of
    Mexico in 1790 to take possession of this coast.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Alberta</span>: province of Canada. This area was created
    a district in 1882, enlarged and erected into a province
    in 1905 by the Federal Government of Canada.</p>
<p>It bestowed the privilege of naming this new district
    on the Marquis of Lorne, Governor-General of Canada,
    1878-&rsquo;83. He named it Alberta in honour of his wife,
    H.R.H. Princess Louise Caroline Alberta.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Albion</span>: township in Peel county, Ontario.</p>
<p>It is an ancient name for England, a favourite of
    poets.</p>

<p>Originally Albion (from the Latin <i>albus</i>, white, referring
    to the white cliffs of the southern shore) included the
    whole island, Britain, but gradually became restricted to
    England, and the variant Albyn to the Highlands of
    Scotland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>
<p>It is named after Aldborough in Suffolk, England.
    Aldborough was the birthplace of Rev. George Crabbe,
    1754-1832, a poet of distinction at this time. The Aldborough
    writer&rsquo;s themes were social and attracted the
    attention of Simcoe and his staff, who suggested so many
    of the place-names of Upper Canada.</p>

    Ontario, incorporated on January 1st, 1903.</p>
<p>The disbanded regiment of the Glengarry Fencibles,
    accompanied by their chaplain, Father Alexander MacDonell,
    settled in this locality in 1803. One of the first
    buildings erected in what is now the town of Alexandria
    was the grist-mill built about the year 1821. It was the
    project of Father MacDonell who was the second priest
    in the district and who was afterwards the first Bishop
    of Kingston, the first Roman Catholic Bishop in the
    Province. The place was known for some years as
    Priest&rsquo;s Mills. It was afterwards changed to Alexandria
    derived from the Reverend Father&rsquo;s Christian name.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Alfred</span>: township in Prescott county, Ontario, formed
    in 1798.</p>
<p>It is said to have been named after Prince Alfred, a
    son of George III., who died in youth.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Algoma</span>: district in northern Ontario.</p>
<p>The origin of the name is a debated question but it is
    generally held to be derived from the Indian word <i>Algonquin</i>, spelled Al-gom-me-quin by Champlain in 1632.
    An official aboriginal map of 1857 shows the whole of this
    district to have been Algonquin territory. Mr. Hugh Ray
    of the Legislative Library, Toronto, an Algonquin scholar,
    derives the word from <i>Ah-ga-mic</i>, meaning &ldquo;the other
    side of the water (lake)&rdquo;, describing its relation to
    Manitoulin Island.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Algona</span>: township in Renfrew county, Ontario, formed
    in 1857.</p>
<p>This word is compounded from parts of two Indian
    words, <i>Algonquin</i> and <i>Akee</i> or <i>ace</i>, meaning earth or land,
    &ldquo;the land of the Algonquins&rdquo;. It is common in Indian
    compounds to make a part of a word carry the meaning
    of the whole.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Algonquin</span>: National Park of Ontario. It is situated
    in Nipissing district and was set aside for this purpose
    in 1893 by the Legislature of Ontario. The Park comprises
    nearly 2,000 square miles of forests, lakes and
    streams. The forests are alive with deer, moose, beaver
    and wild fowl of many kinds. The lakes and streams
    abound in shining fish. Algonquin is paradise for the
    wildings of the wood.</p>
<p>The Park took its name from the Algonquins who
    excelled most of the Indian tribes in arts and other attainments.
    By the Iroquois they were called Adirondacks,
    that is &ldquo;bark-eaters&rdquo;, in derision. In sober Indian they
    were called <i>Odis qua gume</i>, that is &ldquo;people at the end of
    the water&rdquo;. They are supposed to have been at the head
    of a northern confederacy and to have descended the
    Ottawa at the close of the 10th century and to have
    occupied the left bank of the St. Lawrence. This family
    of Indians received the generic name Algonquins from the
    French, formerly thought to have been contracted from <i>Algomequin</i>, meaning &ldquo;those on the other side&rdquo;, but now
    generally believed to be derived from the Micmac <i>Algoo-making</i>,
    meaning &ldquo;at the place of spearing fish&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Alice</span>: township in Renfrew county, Ontario, formed
    in 1855.</p>
<p>It is supposed to have been named after Princess Alice
    Maud Mary, second daughter of Queen Victoria. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span> was, perhaps, the best loved and most popular of the
    Queen&rsquo;s daughters. Princess Alice married Louis IV.,
    grand Duke of Hesse, in 1862. Her family were afflicted
    with the dread disease of diphtheria in 1878, and in the
    agony of death the Princess mother kissed one of her
    children. It proved the kiss of death.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Allan</span>: township in Manitoulin, Ontario.</p>
<p>It was named after Hon. G. W. Allan, a Senator of
    Canada. His father, Hon. William Allan, settled in York,
    Upper Canada, during Governor Simcoe&rsquo;s regime. In
    1857 Senator Allan presented Toronto with five acres of
    land which now is known as the Horticultural (Allan)
    Gardens.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Allandale</span>: town, Simcoe county, Ontario.</p>
<p>The place was named Barrie Station on the completion
    of the Huron, Ontario and Simcoe Railway (now
    C.N.R.), to this point in 1854. When a spur was constructed
    to Barrie the name was changed to Allandale in
    honour of Hon. G. W. Allan who owned land in this
    vicinity and was a friend of those who promoted and constructed
    the Railway. See <i>Allan</i>.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Allenby</span>: mount, 9,500 feet, in the Rockies, Alberta.</p>
<p>It is named after Field-Marshal Lord Allenby of
    Megiddo and Felixtowe, captor of Jerusalem in the Great
    War, 1914-&rsquo;18. For the title of Megiddo, see Judges
    (Bible), v. 19, and for Felixtowe, see Suffolk, England.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Alliston</span>: town in Simcoe county, Ontario.</p>
<p>It was founded by William Fletcher in 1850, who was
    the first settler to locate where the town now stands. He
    named it after his birthplace, Alliston, a village in Yorkshire,
    England, according to some authorities. The
    gazetteers do not list an English Alliston.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Almonte</span>: town in Lanark county, Ontario.</p>
<p>The place was originally (1821), known as Shipman&rsquo;s
    Falls. Later a post office was opened up under the name
    of Ramsayville. Still later rival village sites were surveyed
    in adjoining territory. On the suggestion of Lieutenant-Colonel
    Gemmill, a citizen of great personal popularity
    and a large property owner, all were united under
    the name of Almonte in honour of the Mexican General
    of that name. This was between 1850 and 1860.</p>
<p>General Juan Almonte was a natural son of the famous
    priest Morelos, one of the many patriotic churchmen who
    fought and gave their lives for the liberation of Mexico
    from the Spanish yoke. He was executed in 1815 after
    trial before the Holy Inquisition. Almonte&rsquo;s mother was
    Indian.</p>
<p>Information from J. T. Kirkland, D.C.L., Police Magistrate,
    Almonte.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Alnwick</span>: (pronounced Annick), township in Northumberland
    county, Ontario, formed in 1798.</p>
<p>It is called after Alnwick, the county town of Northumberland,
    England. The castle of Alnwick is celebrated
    in British history. It is the residence of the Duke of
    Northumberland. The town of Alnwick takes its name
    from the river Alne which flows near by and old English
    &ldquo;wick&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;a dwelling-place or village&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Alton</span>: village on Credit River, Peel county, Ontario.</p>
<p>This locality was settled by families from the Niagara
    district about 1880. Several years later&mdash;about 1848&mdash;a
    public meeting was called to select a name for the place.
    Williamstown was chosen at first after a member of the
    McClellan family of the district. On further consideration
    a Mr. Meek suggested Alton. He had been reading
    of Alton in Illinois, a place resembling the Canadian
    situation in many respects.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>
<p>The city of Alton, Illinois, is on a high limestone bluff,
    somewhat hilly, 200 feet above the waters of the Mississippi
    River. In all probability the name Alton was
    derived from the Latin <i>altus</i>, <i>a</i>, <i>um</i>, meaning &ldquo;high&rdquo; and
    English &ldquo;town&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Amabel</span>: township in Bruce county, Ontario, formed
    in 1855.</p>
<p>It was named after Henrietta Amabel Yorke, daughter
    of Rev. Philip Yorke, of Ely, and sister of Anna Maria
    Yorke, wife of Sir Edmund Walker Head, Governor-General
    of Canada, 1855-&rsquo;61.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Amaranth</span>: township in Dufferin county, formed in
    1821.</p>
<p>It is called after a genus of plants having several
    species. The flower is small and inclines to a purple
    colour. The term amaranth is derived from a Greek word
    meaning &ldquo;unfading&rdquo;. The flower retains its colour so
    long that it is applied in poetry to an imaginary flower
    that never fades.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Ameliasburg</span>: township in Prince Edward county,
    Ontario, formed in 1787.</p>
<p>It was named after Princess Amelia, youngest child
    of George III. It is said that her early death in 1810 at
    twenty-seven years of age, affected the King&rsquo;s reason.</p>
<p><span class="bold">America</span>: Canada of to-day and Newfoundland were
    known generally as British America from 1763 to 1867,
    and are still frequently so designated.</p>
<p>The word America is derived from the Christian name
    of Amerigo Vespucci (latinized form Americus Vespucius)
    who sailed westward on an expedition of explor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>ation,
    according to his own account, in 1497 and on June
    6th of that year reached the coast of what is now known
    as Dutch Guiana in South America. During the next
    four years Amerigo made two more voyages, reaching
    the coast of Brazil. On his return he published an
    account of what he had seen, the first printed description
    of the mainland of the Western Hemisphere.</p>
<p>A German professor of Geography, named Waldseemuller,
    teaching in St. Die College,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> read Amerigo Vespucci&rsquo;s
    account and in 1507 he printed a little book in
    Latin entitled <i>An Introduction to Geography</i>. In this
    work occurred this sentence, &ldquo;And the fourth part of the
    world having been discovered by Amerigo or Americus,
    we may call it Amerige or <i>America</i>&rdquo;. This pamphlet on
    geography made its way into the schools of Western
    Europe and the schoolmaster&rsquo;s newly-coined word was
    permanently stamped on the Western Hemisphere.</p>
<p>Whether Amerigo Vespucci is entitled to the honour
    or not, no man has such a monument as he, for his name
    is written across the map of two continents. If he saw
    the coast of the main land on June 6th, 1497, he discovered
    America eighteen days before John Cabot, who
    reached it on June 24th of that year, and more than a
    year before Columbus saw the mainland, third voyage,
    August 1, 1498. Many historians, however, dispute
    Amerigo&rsquo;s claim, believing he did not make his first voyage
    until 1499, and that John Cabot was the true discoverer
    of the continent of America.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Amherst</span>: city in Nova Scotia; island, eastern end of
    Lake Ontario; and burg or town in Essex county, Ontario.</p>
<p>They were named after Field-Marshal Sir Jeffery
    Amherst, Commander-in-Chief of the British forces at
    the capture of Louisburg in 1758. He took part with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span> Wolfe in the taking of Canada from the French, and
    compelled Montreal to surrender in 1760. He was the
    first Governor-General of Canada. Amherst was also
    Governor of Virginia. In 1768 he opposed the Stamp Act
    for which he was dismissed.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Amundsen</span>: gulf, south of Banks Island, Franklin
    district, named after Roald Amundsen who sailed his
    ship, the <i>Gzoa</i>, through the North-west Passage from the
    Atlantic to the Pacific, 1903-&rsquo;06. Amundsen and his four
    Norwegian countrymen discovered the South Pole, Dec.
    15, 1911.</p>
<p>On his non-stop flight from Kings Bay, Spitzbergen, to
    Teller, near Nome, Alaska, May 11-12, 1926, Amundsen
    crossed the North Pole. The flight was taken in the air-ship <i>Norge</i>, an Italian-built dirigible. On board were
    Amundsen (Norwegian), Ellsworth (American), Nobile
    (Italian), Commander, Larsen (Norwegian), navigator,
    and a crew of thirteen. They dropped three flags on the
    Pole, Norwegian, American and Italian, representing all
    nationalities on the air-ship. The cargo of the <i>Norge</i> weighed twelve tons. Point Barrow on the coast of
    Alaska, some 2,500 miles from Kings Bay, was sighted
    in forty-six hours after the start.</p>
<p>Captain Roald Amundsen with René Guilband, a
    French airman, and four others in a seaplane joined in
    the search for General Umberto Nobile and party of the
    Polar dirigible <i>Italia</i> wrecked on its return to Spitzbergen
    from the North Pole in June, 1928. While General
    Umberto Nobile and some members of his expedition were
    rescued by the Swedish pilot Lieut. E. Lundborg, no trace
    of Amundsen or any of his companions has been discovered.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Ancaster</span>: township in Wentworth county, Ontario,
    formed in 1792.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>
<p>It was named after the district called Ancaster in
    Lincolnshire, England. Many Roman remains have been
    found in this neighbourhood, bearing evidence that it was
    one of their strong military camps. This word is probably
    derived from the Latin particle <i>an</i> signifying important
    and <i>castra</i> a camp.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Anderdon</span>: township in Essex county, Ontario, formed
    in 1837.</p>
<p>It is an English family name, members of which were
    conspicuous at that time both in church and state. It is
    uncertain, however, after what particular member it was
    named.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Anglesea</span>: township in Addington county, Ontario,
    formed in 1822.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Henry William Paget, Earl
    of Uxbridge and Marquis of Anglesea. During the
    French Revolution he served in Flanders under Prince
    Frederick, Duke of York, and in the Peninsula under Sir
    John Moore. At Waterloo he was second in command
    to the Duke of Wellington, commanding the allied cavalry.
    In this battle he lost one of his legs. His title was taken
    from the Isle and County of Anglesea in North Wales.
    The Saxons gave the island this name, Anglesey, that is
    &ldquo;Englishmen&rsquo;s Island&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Anglin</span>: township in Nipissing district, formed in
    1887.</p>
<p>It is named after Hon. Timothy Warren Anglin. In
    1867 he was elected to the House of Commons for Gloucester,
    N.B., and in 1874 was chosen Speaker. After the
    defeat of the Mackenzie Government in 1878, Mr. Anglin
    became an official of the Ontario Government.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Annapolis</span>: county and town in Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>When Port Royal was taken from the French in 1710
    by the British led by Commander Francis Nicholson, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span> renamed the place Annapolis in honour of Queen Anne.
    The word is formed from English Anne and Greek <i>polis</i> &ldquo;a city&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Port Royal was founded by De Monts in 1605. Romantic
    memories cluster about the little town, more
    thrilling than any in Canada with the exception perhaps
    of Quebec. A fort and village were here three years
    before a white man had built on the site of Quebec. The
    first conversion of natives to Christianity occurred at
    Port Royal. Here the first vessel built in North America
    was launched, the first wheat and root crops grown, and
    the first flour mill constructed.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Anson</span>: township in Haliburton, Ontario, formed in
    1858.</p>
<p>It is named after a distinguished English family. One
    member, George Anson, was Commander-in-Chief of the
    British forces in India where he died of cholera in 1857.
    He served at Waterloo with the Scots Fusilier Guards.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Anstruther</span>: township in Peterborough county, Ontario,
    formed in 1861.</p>
<p>It is named after a town in Fifeshire, Scotland. The
    name is sometimes contracted to Anster. In British history
    there have been several distinguished statesmen and
    soldiers by the name of Anstruther. Lieut.-Col. A. W.
    Anstruther, who commanded the Royal Artillery at Halifax,
    N.S., in 1890, was descended from a Fife family that
    traced its lineage back to the Norman Conquest.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Anticosti</span>: large island in the Gulf of St. Lawrence.</p>
<p>Most authorities derive the word from Montagnais
    Indian, <i>Natiscotec</i>, by clerical transposition. The meaning
    of the Indian term is &ldquo;where bears are hunted&rdquo;. Some
    think the word has a Spanish origin, <i>anti</i>, &ldquo;before or beyond&rdquo;,
    and <i>costa</i>, &ldquo;coast&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Antigonish</span>: county, town and harbour in Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>It is a Micmac Indian word, meaning, according to
    most authorities, &ldquo;broken branches&rdquo;. It is said that beech
    trees used to grow in exuberance here and bears used to
    frequent the spot to procure beech-nuts from the branches
    which they broke down.</p>
<p>Some give the meaning, &ldquo;River of fish&rdquo;, descriptive of
    the abundance of fish in the creek emptying into Antigonish
    harbour.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Appin</span>: pleasant village in Middlesex county, Ontario.</p>
<p>It took its name from Appin in Scotland. As parish,
    mountainous district, village, or valley the name occurs
    in Argyleshire, Fifeshire and Perthshire.</p>
<p>Appin signifies &ldquo;abbey lands&rdquo;, that is an estate
    annexed to the Church. The word is derived from the
    Gaelic <i>abaid</i> meaning &ldquo;abbey&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Arichat</span>: island, town on the island and village on the
    mainland, Richmond county, Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>The town of Arichat is a seaport, having a fine harbour,
    and the centre of business for the county. On some
    maps the island is marked Isle Madame, in honour of
    Sainte Marie.</p>
<p>The word is Micmac Indian, a corruption of Nerichat
    meaning &ldquo;the camping ground&rdquo;. Another Indian name
    for the island was Liksake, meaning &ldquo;worn rocks&rdquo;. Arichat
    is the see of a Roman Catholic bishop.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Armstrong</span>: city in British Columbia.</p>
<p>Named in 1892 after Hector Armstrong of London,
    England, who negotiated the bonds for the Shuswap and
    Okanagan Railway.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Arnold</span>: river flowing into Lake Megantic through
    Spider River, Quebec.</p>
<p>It is named after Col. (afterwards General) Benedict
    Arnold of the United States Army. It was down this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span> river that he marched against Quebec city in October,
    1775, after ascending the Kennebec River from the
    Atlantic Ocean and crossing the intervening height of
    land.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Arnprior</span>: town in Renfrew county, Ontario.</p>
<p>The place was named after a priory on the Arn River
    in Northern Scotland. It was probably called Arnpriory
    at first and abbreviated later to its present form.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Aroostook</span>: village and important tributary of the St.
    John River, New Brunswick.</p>
<p>The word is Maliseet Indian but its meaning is uncertain.</p>
<p>Dr. W. F. Ganong states it may be a corruption of
    Woolastook, the Maliseet name for the St. John, which
    means &ldquo;good river&rdquo; (for navigation).</p>
<p>M. Maurault translates this word &ldquo;a river whose bed
    or channel is composed of tinsel, handsome river.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="bold">Arran</span>: township in Bruce county, Ontario, formed in
    1850.</p>
<p>It is named after the island of Arran in the Firth of
    Clyde, from which presumably early settlers emigrated.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Arras</span>: mountain, 10,180 feet high in the Rockies, B.C.</p>
<p>It was so named to commemorate the battles of Arras,
    France, in the Great War, in both of which the Canadian
    forces participated: first battle, April, 1917; second
    battle, August, 1918.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Artemisia</span>: township in Grey county, Ontario, formed
    in 1822.</p>
<p>It is a Greek word meaning &ldquo;worm-wood&rdquo; derived
    from Artemis, the Greek Diana, to whom worm-wood was
    dedicated. Diana translated literally means &ldquo;the divine
    female&rdquo;. Doubtless gallantry suggested the appellation.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Arthabaska</span>: county in Quebec, and also a canton in
    this county and the county of Megantic, erected in 1802.</p>
<p>The word is Iroquois Indian meaning &ldquo;a place obstructed
    by reeds and grass&rdquo;. The term was applied in the
    first instance to the water-ways of the district.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Arthur</span>: township in Wellington county, Ontario,
    formed in 1835.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Arthur Wellesley, Duke of

<p><span class="bold">Ashby</span>: township in Addington county, Ontario,
    formed in 1857.</p>
<p>It is said to have taken its name from Ashby de la
    Zouche, a town in Leicestershire, England. In it is an
    old castle in which Mary, Queen of Scots was once confined.
    There are fifteen villages in England having the

<p>It is the Greek name of a plant of the lily family,

    to the surveyor.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Assiginack</span>: township in Manitoulin Island, formed in

<p>It was named after a well known local Indian of the
    period, a great drunkard in his youth, but was converted
    to Christianity and baptized Jean Baptiste Assiginack.
    He rendered military service to the British in 1812, later
    he acted as interpreter and assistant to the Superintendent
    of Indian Affairs. He was so voluble of tongue, but
    intelligent withal, that he was known in the island as
    Black Bird. He died in 1866, aged ninety-eight.</p>

    on the Humber River, in the western suburbs of
    Toronto.</p>
<p>It took its name from the Hon. Jacques (James) Baby.
    His family was of French descent, one of the most ancient
    and honourable in New France. His father had removed
    from Lower Canada to Detroit (in Upper Canada till
    1796) before the Conquest of Quebec in 1759. After Canada
    passed into the hands of Great Britain, the family
    was distinguished for adherence to the British Crown.
    James Baby was Colonel of the 1st Kent Regiment in the
    War of 1812.</p>
<p>On the recommendation of Lieut.-Governor Simcoe,
    Mr. James Baby was appointed in 1792, by the Home
    Government, a member of both the first Legislative Council
    and the first Executive Council of Upper Canada. In
    the same year he was elected member of the first parliament
    of Upper Canada, representing two constituencies,
    York and Lincoln. For his notable services Simcoe
    granted Baby a park lot in the town of York and a rural
    lot on the Humber. Baby Point is part of his land grant

    place with an island near-by&rdquo;. While an island is adjacent

    Leeds county, Ontario, settled 1820-&rsquo;22 by immigrants

    county, Ireland.</p>
<p>The origin of part of this name is uncertain. Bally is
    a term found in many Irish place-names and means
    &ldquo;town, community&rdquo;. In his <i>History of the County of
    Wexford</i> published in 1911, Herbert Hone states &ldquo;The
    name [Ballycanew] probably signifies &lsquo;Conway&rsquo;s town&rsquo;
    but no original Irish authority has been or probably ever
    will be discovered to prove whether this conjecture is
    correct.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After considerable investigation the writer is of the
    opinion that the name is a corruption of Bally-an-noe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span> meaning &ldquo;the new town&rdquo;. In Irish <i>an</i> is the form of the

    the House in the stormy days preceding the Rebellion of
    1837. Accused by Lieut.-Governor Sir Bond Head of connection
    with the rebellion, he left Canada for the United
    States and never returned. He was a lawyer by profession
    and rose to eminence in New York. It must be
    added that Mr. Bidwell denied having sympathy with the
    rebels and time seems to have cleared him of the charge.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Biggar</span>: township in Nipissing district, Ontario,
    erected in 1881.</p>
<p>It takes its name from Mr. James Lyon Biggar who
    was M.P.P. for East Northumberland from 1861 to 1867
    and M.P. for the same constituency from 1874 to 1878.
    His family emigrated to Canada from the town of Biggar,
    Lanark, Scotland.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Billings</span>: township in Manitoulin, Ontario, surveyed
    in 1864.</p>
<p>It takes its name from Elkanah Billings, F.R.G.S.,
    born near Ottawa in 1820. He practised law until he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span> appointed palæontologist on the geological survey of Canada.
    Mr. Billings made a large collection of fossils from
    the rocks in the Ottawa district and in 1856 founded the <i>Canadian Naturalist</i>.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Binbrook</span>: township in Wentworth county, Ontario,
    erected in 1798.</p>
<p>It was named after the village of Binbrook in the
    county of Lincoln, England.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Birdwood</span>: mount, 10,160 feet high, in the Rocky
    Mountains, Alberta.</p>
<p>It was named after General Sir William Birdwood who
    commanded the Anzacs (Australian and New Zealand
    Army Corps) in the Great War, 1914-&rsquo;18.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Birkenhead</span>: tributary of the Lillooet River, above
    Lillooet Lake, British Columbia.</p>
<p>It was named by Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company officials in
    memory of the British transport steamer <i>Birkenhead</i> wrecked on the rocks near the Cape of Good Hope in 1852.
    All the women and children were saved, but four hundred
    soldiers and sailors, after displaying all the British traditions
    of the sea, went down with the ship.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Birtle</span>: county and town in Manitoba, about 200 miles
    north-west of Winnipeg. The town was founded in 1880.</p>
<p>The word Birtle is a contraction of Birdtail, the name
    of a river running through the town. In former days this
    stream was much frequented by wild birds and the
    Indians gathered along its shores feathers suitable for
    making their head dresses, hence the name.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Bishop</span>: township in Nipissing, Ontario, formed in
    1884.</p>
<p>It takes its name from Archibald Bishop, M.P.P. for
    South Huron, 1873-&rsquo;94.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>
<p>Bishop is also the name of a mount, 9,300 feet high,
    in the Rockies, Alberta and British Columbia.</p>
<p>It was named after Col. W. A. Bishop, V.C., D.S.O.,
    M.C., distinguished Canadian airman of the Great War.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Blair</span>: township in Parry Sound district, Ontario, surveyed
    in 1878.</p>
<p>Its origin is uncertain. It has been suggested that it
    was named after the Hon. Timothy Blair Pardee who was
    Commissioner of Crown Lands, 1873-&rsquo;88. Others think it
    was named in honour of Hon. Adam Johnson Fergusson
    Blair who was Receiver-General and Provincial Secretary
    before Confederation, 1867.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Blandford</span>: township in Oxford county, Ontario,
    formed in 1798.</p>
<p>It takes its name from the second title of the Dukes
    of Marlborough&mdash;Marquis of Blandford. Since 1702 this
    title has been borne by the eldest son of the Duke. The
    title was taken from the town of Blandford in Dorsetshire.
    The name occurs in Doomsday Book.</p>
<p>The fortunes of the Marlborough family were founded
    by John Churchill. History awards him great military
    talents but unscrupulous character. Queen Anne conferred
    on him a dukedom and great wealth for his victories
    over the French.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Blanshard</span>: township in Perth county, Ontario, formed
    in 1831.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Richard Blanshard, a director
    of the Canada Land Company. This Company of
    British capitalists, formed in 1825 by John Galt, bought
    at a nominal sum two and a half million acres of wild
    land in Upper Canada from the Family Compact government.
    The Company did much good work in the way of
    settlement but in some districts, especially in Huron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span> county, impeded colonization by holding lands for speculation.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Blenheim</span>: township in Oxford county, Ontario,
    erected in 1798.</p>
<p>It takes its name from Blenheim in Oxford County,
    England, the estate bestowed on John Churchill, Duke
    of Marlborough, for his victory over the French and
    Bavarians at Blenheim in 1704. Half a million sterling
    was voted by parliament to erect a castle for the family
    on these grounds.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Blithefield</span>: township in Renfrew county, Ontario,
    formed in 1843.</p>
<p>It took its name from Blithefield House, the home of
    the Bagot family in Staffordshire, England. Sir Charles
    Bagot was the popular governor of Canada when this
    township was erected.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Blomidon</span>: majestic promontory extending into Minas
    Basin, 670 feet high, which forms the abrupt eastern
    termination of the north mountain chain, Kings County,
    Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>The origin of the name is uncertain. Some authors
    state it is Portuguese. The Indian name for this wondrous
    Cape was Plekteok, meaning &ldquo;a hand spike&rdquo;, descriptive
    of its shape. Navigators of former days were
    fond of speaking of it by the name of Blow-me-down.</p>
<p>Many writers, inspired by the scene, have told the
    story:</p>

<p><span class="bold">Blyth</span>: enterprising village on the C.P.R. in Huron
    county, Ontario.</p>
<p>The first settlers, families by the name of McConnell
    and McBean, arrived in 1851. One Wm. Drummond came
    in 1853 and had the land surveyed into village lots. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span> place was called Drummondville until 1876. By special
    act of the county council in that year it was incorporated
    as a village and took the name of Blyth after an English
    estate of that name which owned considerable land in and
    around the village.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Bobcaygeon</span>: romantic town in Victoria county, Ontario.</p>
<p>The word was applied at first only to the double gateway
    connecting Sturgeon Lake to Pigeon Lake. It is
    Mississauga Indian, meaning &ldquo;rocky portal&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Bond Head</span>: village in Simcoe county, Ontario.</p>
<p>The name was given in honour of Sir Francis Bond
    Head, Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada, 1836-&rsquo;38. It
    was suggested by Joel Flesher Robinson, first Postmaster
    of the place and an ardent admirer of the Governor.</p>
<p>Sir Francis took up the reins of administration in
    Upper Canada when political discord was at its height.
    He was an opponent of responsible government and so
    lost the sympathy of a large section of the people of the
    Province. His hands may have been tied by the Home
    Colonial office. However, the Governor was not equal to
    the occasion and his administration was a failure.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Bonfield</span>: township in Nipissing district, Ontario,
    formed in 1881.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of James Bonfield, M.P.P. for
    South Renfrew. Mr. Bonfield was a lumber merchant and
    was elected to the Legislature in 1875.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Boothia</span>: peninsula and a gulf, North-west Territories.</p>
<p>They were discovered by Captain Sir James Ross during
    his expedition of 1829-&rsquo;33, and named by him after
    Sir Felix Booth who was chiefly instrumental in fitting
    out the expedition. Boothia is of great interest on
    account of its connection with Sir John Franklin&rsquo;s expedition
    in which all hands perished after discovering the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span> North-west Passage. It is of scientific importance, too,
    because the north magnetic pole was first distinctly
    localized here by Ross, on the western side of the Island,
    in 70° 5&#8242; N; 96° 47&#8242; W.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Borden</span>: island in Franklin district, and also of a
    glacier, coast district, B.C.</p>
<p>They are named in honour of Sir Robert Borden,
    Prime Minister of Canada from 1911 to 1920. Borden is,
    too, the name of a point and town, lot 27, Prince Edward
    Island, named after Sir Robert in 1916.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Bosanquet</span>: township in Lambton county, Ontario,
    surveyed in 1830.</p>
<p>It was so designated in honour of Charles Bosanquet,
    M.P., Great Britain, and first Governor of the Canada
    Land Company, organized in 1825. One tract of the Company&rsquo;s
    grant of two and a half million acres was in
    Lambton county.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Boulter</span>: township in Nipissing district, Ontario,
    erected in 1881.</p>
<p>It was named after Dr. George Henry Boulter, M.P.P.
    for North Hastings, 1867-&rsquo;75.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Bow</span>: lake, river, and glacier in Alberta.</p>
<p>The Indians secured timber of excellent quality for
    &ldquo;bow&rdquo; making in this district, hence the name.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Bowmanville</span>: town in Durham county, Ontario.</p>
<p>It was named after Charles Bowman who at one time
    owned most of the land on which the town is built.
    Bowmanville was incorporated as a town in 1858.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Brabant</span>: harbour and island at the entrance to
    Mackenzie River, Mackenzie district.</p>
<p>It took its name from A. G. Brabant, fur commissioner,
    Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company. Mr. Brabant had charge
    of this district for several years.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Bracebridge</span>: town in Muskoka district, Ontario, incorporated
    in 1887. Its early name was North Mills.</p>
<p>When the post office was opened its present name was
    given to the place by the Postmaster-General&rsquo;s office at
    Ottawa. There is a town of Bracebridge near Lincoln,
    England, from which the name may have been taken.
    However, a post office was opened at McCabe&rsquo;s Landing
    under the name of Gravenhurst about the same time
    Bracebridge office was opened and it is surmised that the
    names of both these Muskoka towns were taken from
    Washington Irving&rsquo;s tale, &ldquo;Bracebridge Hall.&rdquo; See Gravenhurst.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Bradford</span>: town in Simcoe county, Ontario.</p>
<p>It took its name from Bradford, Yorkshire, England.
    One of the pioneers of this district was Joel Flesher
    Robinson who had come from the vicinity of the English
    city and he suggested the name. It was officially recognized
    by the Post Office Department in 1850.</p>
<p>In Doomsday Book the name of the English city is
    written Bradeford, that is &ldquo;broad ford&rdquo;, presumably on
    the Aire River near by.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Brampton</span>: county-town of Peel county, Ontario.</p>
<p>Brampton is a market town in Cumberland, England.
    It is picturesquely situated and rich in historical associations.
    Early settlers, doubtless, suggested the name of
    their old home. Henry Hawkins, Brampton, 1817-1909,
    was a distinguished member of the legal profession of
    Great Britain. His name is identified with many famous
    trials of the period.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Brandon</span>: city in Manitoba.</p>
<p>The name Brandon House was given to a Hudson&rsquo;s
    Bay Company trading post on the Assiniboine River,
    seventeen miles from the present city, in 1794. The
    Douglas family, of which the Duke of Brandon, Suffolk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span> county, England, was a member, held one-third of the
    stock of the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Brant and Brantford</span>: county and city in Ontario.</p>
<p>The county of Brant and the city of Brantford, Ontario,
    are named after Joseph Brant (Thayendanaga),
    the Mohawk chief, 1742-1807, leader of the Six Nation
    Indians. They were accustomed to cross the Grand River
    in the vicinity of the site of the present city, hence
    Brant&rsquo;s ford, now written, Brantford. Brant was an ally
    of the English in the revolutionary war of 1775-&rsquo;83. For
    his services he was granted for his people a territory on
    the Grand River, six miles in width from its source to its
    mouth. He was a Christian and greatly respected by all.
    Brant translated the Gospel of St. Mark into the Mohawk
    language.</p>
<p>Mohawk is an Algonquin word and means &ldquo;cannibal&rdquo;.
    It was applied to this Iroquois tribe by their enemies.
    The name by which the Mohawks called themselves was
    Caniengas, i.e., &ldquo;People-at-the-Flint&rdquo;. Vide <i>The Iroquois
    Book of Rites</i> by H. Hale.</p>
<p>Brantford and environs are of much historic interest.
    They are associated with a great Indian migration; the
    storied Mohawk church; Pauline Johnson, Indian poetess;
    Alexander Graham Bell, inventor of the telephone, and
    several distinguished statesmen.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Bras d&rsquo;Or</span>: lake in Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>The origin of the term is uncertain. Some writers
    derive it from the French <i>bras d&rsquo;or</i>, or <i>d&rsquo;eau</i>, &ldquo;the arm
    of gold&rdquo;, or <i>water</i>, descriptive of the configuration of the
    shore or of the mines of the precious metal which the
    early explorers supposed it to contain. Other authorities
    give Le Lac de Labrador, meaning &ldquo;the lake of the
    labourer&rdquo;. This name is found on early maps and it is the
    more likely origin. It is said that the early Spanish and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span> Portuguese navigators carried off the natives of these
    shores to labour in their home lands.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Brighton</span>: township, Northumberland county, Ontario,
    formed in 1852.</p>
<p>It was named after Brighton village in the same
    county, settled at an earlier date. The village was named
    after the famous watering place in Sussex, England,
    because of its long beach extending into Lake Ontario.
    The word Brighton is an abbreviation of Brighthelmstone,
    derived from Brighthelm, the name of a Saxon
    Bishop who resided there and the Anglo-Saxon suffix <i>stan</i> meaning &ldquo;most noble&rdquo; or &ldquo;highest&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">British Columbia</span>: province of Canada, so named in
    honour of Christopher Columbus, commonly called the
    discoverer of the New World, 1492.</p>
<p>By 1805 the region between the 49th and 60th parallels
    of latitude, and the main ridge of the Rocky Mountains
    on the east, and the Pacific Ocean on the west, was called
    New Caledonia. A few years before Confederation
    (1867), Vancouver Island was annexed to the mainland
    by act of the Imperial Parliament, and the united colonies
    became the province of British Columbia on the suggestion
    of Queen Victoria to whom an appeal for a name
    had been made. New Caledonia was discarded because
    it was borne by a colony or island in the south Pacific
    belonging to France.</p>
<p>Caledonia was the Roman name for Scotland. It is
    still so used in poetry. It is a Latin word applied to a
    blue or greenish blue mineral, sulphate of lead and copper,
    found in Scotland.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Brock and Brockville</span>: The township of Brock, Ontario
    county, Ontario, erected in 1817, and the large town of
    Brockville, Leeds county, Ontario, are named in honour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span> of Major-General Sir Isaac Brock who fell in defence of
    Canada at Queenston, October 13, 1812.</p>
<p>For his brilliant capture of Detroit on August 16th
    of the same year King George III. knighted Brock, but he
    was in his grave before the news reached Canada. The
    King took a novel way of informing the Hero of Upper
    Canada of the honour conferred on him. He sent him a
    very large and beautifully executed gold medal, made to
    suspend from the neck. On the obverse is &ldquo;Detroit&rdquo;
    exquisitely engraved; on the reverse, the figure of Britannia,
    and round the rim &ldquo;Major-General Sir Isaac
    Brock&rdquo;. In the summer of 1913, when the writer saw
    this medal it was in the possession of the Misses Tupper
    of Guernsey, great-nieces of Sir Isaac.</p>
<p>Isaac Brock was the eighth son of John Brock, Esq.,
    who had a family of ten sons and four daughters. He
    was born on October 6th, 1769, in the parish of St. Peter
    Port, Guernsey&mdash;the year which gave birth to Wellington
    and Napoleon. The old home of the family is still standing,
    a large, well-constructed brick house, but one hundred
    years after the battle of Queenston not one descendant
    of the surname Brock was living.</p>
<p>The boy Brock chose the military profession for his
    career and became an ensign in the King&rsquo;s Regiment in
    his sixteenth year. Promotion followed promotion until
    he became a Major-General on the 4th of June, 1811.
    Canada holds him in the highest esteem not only as an
    able and meritorious officer but as a man of the finest
    moral fibre.</p>
<p>In acknowledgment of the inestimable services of Sir
    Isaac the Imperial Parliament granted the family 12,000
    acres of land, largely in Oxford county, Ontario, and a
    pension of £200 a year for life to each of his surviving
    brothers.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>
<p>Several monuments have been erected in Canada in
    Sir Isaac Brock&rsquo;s memory, the most impressive of which
    stands on Queenston Heights near the spot where he fell.
    Besides the memorial in Westminster Abbey, very
    recently the citizens of Guernsey built a special chapel
    to his memory in the Thirteenth Century Church of St.
    Peter Port.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Brome</span>: county in Quebec.</p>
<p>The origin of the name is uncertain, but it is probably
    named after Brome, Suffolk county, England. Three
    distinguished Englishmen of that name lived in the 17th
    century.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Bromley</span>: township in Renfrew county, Ontario, constituted
    in 1843.</p>
<p>It took its name from Bagot&rsquo;s Bromley, the chief residence
    of the Bagot family, situated in Stafford county,
    England. Sir Charles Bagot, a member of this family,
    was Governor of Canada, 1842-&rsquo;43.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Bronson</span>: township in Nipissing district, Ontario,
    formed in 1888.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of the Hon. E. H. Bronson,
    M.P.P. for Ottawa, 1886-1898. He was a member of the
    Cabinet, without portfolio, from 1890 to 1898.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Bronte</span>: pleasant and thriving village situated on Lake
    Ontario, Halton county, Ontario. The district was settled
    by U.E. Loyalists.</p>
<p>The village was named in honour of Admiral Lord
    Horatio Nelson who fell in the hour of victory at Trafalgar,
    1805. The title Duke of Bronte was conferred on
    him by Ferdinand IV. of the former Neapolitan Kingdom
    for services rendered during state troubles when Nelson&rsquo;s
    command was stationed in the Mediterranean. The title<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span> was taken from the picturesque town of Bronte in Sicily.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Brooke</span>: township, county of Lambton, Ontario,
    erected in 1834.</p>
<p>It may have been named after Sir James Brooke, the
    aggressive Rajah of Sarawak at this period. On the
    other hand Warwick township in this county was constituted
    in the same year and it is probable it was so named
    after one of Warwick&rsquo;s titles, Baron Brooke.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Brougham</span>: township, Renfrew county, Ontario, surveyed
    in 1851.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Henry, Lord Brougham,
    1778-1868. He achieved distinction in law, statesmanship,
    education and literature. The village of Brougham
    and Brougham Hall are in Westmoreland county, England.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Brown</span>: township in Parry Sound district, Ontario,
    constituted in 1872.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of the Hon. George Brown,
    1818-&rsquo;80. He was the founder of the Toronto <i>Globe</i> newspaper,
    leader of the Reform Party in Upper Canada, and
    member of the Canadian Assembly for sixteen years. Mr.
    Brown ardently supported with pen and voice the great
    movement in Canada in favour of representation by
    population, responsible government and the confederation
    of the British North American provinces into the
    Dominion of Canada. He was called to the Senate in
    1873. A statue was erected by subscription to his memory
    in Queen&rsquo;s Park, Toronto.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Bruce</span>: county, Ontario, organized in 1849, and township
    in this county named in 1850.</p>
<p>Both were named in honour of James Bruce, eighth
    Earl of Elgin and twelfth Earl of Kincardine. He was
    Governor of Canada from 1846 to 1855. During his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span> régime responsible government was firmly established.
    The &ldquo;Clergy Reserves&rdquo; were secularized, Seigniorial
    Tenure in Lower Canada was abolished, and a Reciprocity
    Treaty between Canada and the United States was
    arranged, which provided for the free exchange of the
    products of the sea, the soil, the forest and the mine for
    ten years from 1854. In all these matters history
    accords Lord Elgin great tact and wisdom.</p>
<p>The Bruce family is of Norman origin. After the
    battle of Hastings, 1066, William the Norman Conqueror
    sent his knight aide-de-camp, Robert le Brus, to reduce
    northern England to submission. He did his destructive
    mission so well that he was lavishly rewarded with titles
    and estates.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Brulé</span>: point, harbour and bay, Lake Superior, Algoma
    district, Ontario.</p>
<p>They are named after Champlain&rsquo;s famous interpreter
    and explorer, Etienne Brulé. So far as history records,
    he was the first white man to have gazed on the waters of
    three of the Great Lakes, Huron, Ontario, and Superior.
    In 1634 he was clubbed and eaten by the treacherous
    Hurons near Penetanguishene, Ontario. His name is preserved,
    too, in Brulé Cape, Montmorency county, Quebec.
    There is also a point near the mouth of the Humber
    River, Ontario, named after Brulé. It is supposed to be
    the spot on which he and his Indian guides camped on
    their way south in 1615 to arrange an alliance for Champlain
    with the tribes of the Susquehanna against the
    Iroquois.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Brundenell</span>: township in Renfrew county, Ontario,
    constituted in 1857.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of James Thomas Brundenell,
    seventh Earl of Cardigan, 1797-1868. Although he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span> a member of the House of Commons for many years
    before succeeding his father in the Lords, his chief occupation
    was soldiering. By 1830 he was Colonel of the 15th
    Hussars. When the Crimean War, 1854-&rsquo;56, broke out he
    was promoted to the rank of Major-General. He led the
    Six Hundred in the charge of the Light Brigade at Balaclava,
    October 25, 1854, which Tennyson immortalized in
    verse.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Brunel</span>: township in Muskoka district, Ontario, surveyed
    and named in 1862.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of I. K. Brunel, a civil
    engineer of note. He was engineer-in-chief of the Great
    Western Railway in England. Mr. Brunel constructed
    the first steamship that regularly traversed the Atlantic
    Ocean.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Bruton</span>: The township of Bruton, organized in 1862,
    is in Haliburton district, Ontario.</p>
<p>It took its name from the town of Bruton, Somerset
    county, England. In the churchyard of this English town
    is the grave of Robinson Crusoe (Alexander Selkirk), and
    near by the town stands a tower in memory of Alfred the
    Great. The memorial marks the site of Alfred&rsquo;s first
    great battle with the Danish invaders.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Buchanan</span>: township, erected in 1857, in Renfrew
    county, Ontario.</p>
<p>Some authors attribute the honour of the origin of its
    name to the Hon. Isaac Buchanan who was member of
    Parliament for Toronto, 1841-&rsquo;44, and for Hamilton,
    1858-&rsquo;64. Other authorities state it was named after
    George Buchanan of Arnprior. He led some of the Clan
    Buchanan to Canada and was a prominent man in the
    Arnprior district.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Buller</span>: reef, Manitoulin Island, Ontario.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of General Sir Redvers Buller
    who died in 1908. He was conspicuous in the Boer War
    in South Africa, 1899-1902.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Burford</span>: township, Brant county, Ontario, formed in
    1798.</p>
<p>It took its name from Burford, a town in Oxfordshire,
    England. This is another instance of the fondness of the
    first settlers for the name of their old home.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Burgess</span>: township in Leeds county, Ontario, organized
    in 1798.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Rev. Thomas Burgess, a
    personal friend of Premier Addington, by whom he was
    appointed Bishop of Salisbury, England. The Bishop
    was a voluminous writer on many subjects including
    theology and slavery.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Burleigh</span>: township, Peterborough county, Ontario, so
    named in 1822.</p>
<p>Its former appellation of Yea had been, no doubt, a
    humorous suggestion. It owes its present name in all
    probability to William Cecil, Lord Burleigh, Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s
    peerless statesman. In the County of Kinross,
    Scotland, are the ruins of Burleigh Castle.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Burlington</span>: bay, beach, heights, and town in Wentworth
    and Halton counties, Ontario.</p>
<p>In all probability they were named after Bridlington,
    corrupted into Burlington, a town twenty-three miles
    north of Hull, Yorkshire, England, which has a fine beach
    and is a favourite watering-place for the north country
    people.</p>
<p>Chief Joseph Brant on one of his visits to England to
    confer with King George III. over some grievance of his
    people, the Six Nation Indians, was presented to His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span> Majesty at Windsor by the Duke of Wellington. On his
    return Brant called the 3,000 acres in the form of a square
    granted to him by the Government in the vicinity of Burlington
    by the name of Wellington Square. This was the
    original home of the village which was later changed to
    Burlington.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Burns</span>: The township of Burns, Renfrew county, Ontario,
    was formed in 1874.</p>
<p>It was named after Robert Easton Burns, son of the
    Rev. John Burns, one of the early Presbyterian ministers
    in Upper Canada. Young Robert chose the legal profession
    and was appointed to the Bench in 1850.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Burpee</span>: township in Parry Sound district, organized
    in 1876, and Burpee township in Manitoulin Island,
    organized in 1875, both in Ontario.</p>
<p>They were named in honour of Hon. Isaac Burpee,
    Minister of Customs in the Alexander Mackenzie Government,
    1874-&rsquo;78. The explanation of this duplication is that
    the mainland, Parry Sound, was organized by the Crown
    Lands Department of Ontario, and Manitoulin was in
    charge of the Indian Department of the Dominion Government.</p>
<p>The Burpee family was of Huguenot descent. They
    came from France to England in 1570, and to Massachusetts
    in 1642 with the Puritans, and to New Brunswick
    in 1763. Mr. Isaac Burpee represented St. John,
    N.B., in Parliament.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Burritt&rsquo;s Rapids</span>: picturesque village situated on the
    Rideau Canal, Grenville county, Ontario. It possesses
    good water power.</p>
<p>The place was called after Daniel Burritt, U.E.L., who
    with his five sons settled here in 1784.</p>
<p>The Burritts were an old military family and many
    war stories have been told about them. In the family<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span> possession is a cannon ball which, during the War of
    1812-&rsquo;14, left Ogdensburg on an unfriendly visit and
    entered the British officers&rsquo; mess at Prescott, where it
    made short work of the breakfast table. Colonel Daniel
    Burritt, son of the founder of the family in Ontario,
    ordered the ball back through a British cannon with his
    compliments. The ball struck the court house at Ogdensburg
    on its return trip and was preserved as a souvenir.</p>
<p>After the war, when the two towns on either side of
    the St. Lawrence were friendly again, the cannon ball was
    given to one of Col. Burritt&rsquo;s family, Dr. W. H. Burritt, a
    grandson of Daniel Burritt, who practised medicine for
    many years at Smith&rsquo;s Falls and later at Peterborough,
    where he died in 1886.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Burton</span>: township in Parry Sound district, Ontario,
    erected in 1876.</p>
<p>It was named after Hon. Sir George William Burton.
    He came from England to Canada at the age of eighteen
    years and at once took up the study of law. He practised
    law in Hamilton, Ontario, for many years. He was made
    Chief-Justice in 1897 and knighted also the same year.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Butt</span>: township, Nipissing district, Ontario, surveyed
    in 1879.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Isaac Butt, Q.C., M.P.,
    Ireland. Mr. Butt was an eminent member of the Irish
    legal profession, and an author of note. He wrote a
    history of the Kingdom of Italy in two volumes.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Byng</span>: mount, 9,700 feet high, in the Rocky Mountains,
    Alberta.</p>
<p>It was named after General Sir J. H. G. Byng, one of
    the Commanders of the Canadian Army Corps in the
    Great War, 1914-&rsquo;18. He was Governor-General of Canada,
    1921-&rsquo;26.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Cabot</span>: canton or political division of the county of
    Matane, Quebec, erected in 1865.</p>
<p>It was named in memory of John Cabot, the celebrated
    navigator, who discovered the mainland of the New
    World, Labrador, Newfoundland, Cape Breton, in 1497.
    The next year he and his son, Sebastian, visited these
    shores again and followed the coast line southwards to
    Cape Cod. They were the first, perhaps, that knew a
    new continent had been discovered.</p>
<p>The Cabots were a Venetian family who had moved to
    England and settled in Bristol. The father, John Cabot,
    was naturalized in 1476. Having obtained from Henry
    VII. letters-patent directing him to conquer, occupy and
    possess for England all new lands he might find, he
    sailed westward from Bristol in the spring of 1497. Four
    hundred years later, 1897, the Royal Society of Canada
    erected a commemorative tablet in honour of John Cabot
    in the public hall, Halifax, N.S. Newfoundland has also
    erected a memorial Cabot Tower on Signal Hill, The
    Narrows, harbour of St. John&rsquo;s.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Cacouna</span>: a favourite summer resort, south bank of
    St. Lawrence River, Temiscouata county, Quebec.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>
<p>It is derived from two Algonquin Indian words which
    mean &ldquo;the abode of the porcupine&rdquo;, rather a misnomer for
    the watering-place of to-day.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Caistor</span>: township, Lincoln county, Ontario, organized
    in 1798.</p>
<p>It is named after Caistor in Lincoln county, England.
    The stronghold of Caistor was built by Hengist, the
    Saxon. The original name was Thongcaistor. The territory
    contained as much land as could be encircled by an
    ox&rsquo;s hide cut into small thongs. The word is derived from
    Anglo-Saxon <i>thwang</i>, &ldquo;a thong or small string of
    leather&rdquo;, and probably, <i>castel</i>, &ldquo;a camp&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Caledon</span>: township, Peel county, Ontario, erected in
    1819, and Caledonia township, Prescott county, Ontario,
    erected in 1810, called after the name given by the
    Romans to the northern part of Scotland. Caledonia is
    now the poetical name for all Scotland. The origin of the
    term Caledonia is uncertain. It is probably derived from
    the Latin verb <i>celo</i>, <i>celare</i>, to conceal. The Caledonians
    were those who concealed themselves in woody shelters.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Calgary</span>: city in Alberta.</p>
<p>It took its name from a town in the island of Mull,
    Scotland. The name was suggested by Colonel James
    Farquharson MacLeod, R.N.W.M. Police, in 1876, after
    his old home town. The word Calgary is Gaelic. Its
    origin is uncertain. The word is generally stated to mean
    &ldquo;clear running water&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Calumet</span>: island in the Ottawa River.</p>
<p>It is an Indian word meaning pipestone, a good quality
    of stone for Indian pipes was found there. There are also
    a peak and creek of the same name in Jasper Park,
    Alberta.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>
<p>At the foot of Calumet island a mouldering wooden
    cross marks the lonely grave of the heroic French
    voyageur, Cadieux. His &ldquo;Lament&rdquo;, written as he lay
    dying in the grave made by himself, is a touching French-Canadian
    song. See Edgar&rsquo;s <i>Canada and its Capital</i>.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Cambrai</span>: mount, 10,380 feet high, Rocky Mountains,
    Alberta and B.C.</p>
<p>It is named after Cambrai in French Flanders, captured
    by Canadian troops in 1918.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Cambridge</span>: township, Russell county, Ontario, erected
    in 1798.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Prince Adolphus, Duke of
    Cambridge, son of King George III. The title is taken
    from the town of Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, England.
    This town is celebrated for its ancient University.</p>
<p>In James I.&rsquo;s reign a rich hackney man by the name
    of Hobson presented his town of Cambridge with a fountain
    of water, still flowing. His habit of letting out his
    horses in rotation gave rise to the expression, &ldquo;Hobson&rsquo;s
    choice,&rdquo; this or none.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Camden East</span>: township, constituted in 1787, in Addington
    county, Ontario.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Charles Pratt, Earl Camden,
    1714-&rsquo;94, of Devonshire, England. He won distinction
    in his profession of law and became Attorney-General
    under Lord Chatham. In Parliament Camden strongly
    opposed the taxation of the English colonies in America.</p>
<p>Camden East is also the name of a picturesque village
    in this township. Here the distinguished litterateur, Sir
    Gilbert Parker, was born. One of his poems commemorates
    the old home&mdash;</p>

    in 1794.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Cameron</span>: township in Nipissing district, Ontario,
    erected in 1884.</p>
<p>Most authorities state it was named after Sir Matthew
    Crooks Cameron, a distinguished member of the Canadian
    Bar. He was a member of the Ontario Legislature for
    many years, and Provincial Secretary and Commissioner
    of Crown Lands in the John Sandfield Macdonald Government.
    In 1878 he was appointed to the Bench. Mr.
    Cameron was knighted in 1887, and died the same year.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Campbell</span>: township in Manitoulin Island, organized
    and named in 1867.</p>
<p>The honour is generally attributed to Sir Alexander
    Campbell, 1821-&rsquo;92. He was born in Yorkshire, England,
    came to Canada at an early age, and studied law with Sir
    John A. Macdonald at Kingston, Ontario. Mr. Campbell
    achieved distinction in both the Ontario Legislature and
    the Dominion Parliament. He was knighted on May 24,
    1879, and appointed Lieutenant-Governor of Ontario in
    1887, which office he held until his death.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Campobello</span>: island in the Bay of Fundy, N.B.</p>
<p>It was named in 1770 by Captain William Owen to
    whom a large part of the island had been granted. The
    name is said to have been given partly as a pun on the
    name of the Governor Lord William Campbell, and partly
    as descriptive of the island (Latin <i>campus</i>, a camping-ground,
    and <i>bellus</i>, beautiful).</p>
<p><span class="bold">Canada.</span> The derivation generally accepted of our
    country&rsquo;s name is the Iroquois word <i>Kanata</i> or <i>Kanada</i>,
    meaning &ldquo;a cabin, a lodge&rdquo;. The name made its first
    recorded appearance in Cartier&rsquo;s account of his second
    voyage in 1535. The native Gaspé guides that he took
    on board before entering the unknown river informed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span> him that the country thereabout was divided into three
    sections; namely, the Saguenay territory extending from
    the Isle of Anticosti to the Isle Aux Coudres; next Canada
    extending from Coudres to Hochelaga, and the last territory,
    beyond Hochelaga, they reported richest and best
    of all. The name Canada was used by Cartier&rsquo;s Indian
    guides to describe the territory where there were clusters
    of cabins, the section in which the natives had constructed
    somewhat permanent homes.</p>
<p>If the Iroquois word be accepted as the correct derivation,
    therein lies a mystery. The earliest records of Canada
    state the Algonquins occupied all the country from
    the Atlantic seaboard to Lake Ontario. The Algonquin
    word for a settlement is <i>Odanah</i>. Is our spelling of
    Canada a corruption of this word? On the other hand
    Cartier used other Iroquois words in his account of the
    voyage. It may be that the Iroquois occupied the Lower
    St. Lawrence in common with the Algonquins at a still
    earlier period and left traces of their language behind.</p>
<p>R. P. Arnaud, Indian scholar, states the word Canada
    is derived from a Montagnais idiom signifying <i>étranger</i> (French), that is &ldquo;foreign parts&rdquo;, &ldquo;unknown country&rdquo;.
    The Montagnais dwelt in the Saguenay district.</p>
<p>In his geography published in 1760 Thomas Jefferys
    has given the meaning, <i>can</i> &ldquo;the country&rdquo; and <i>ada</i>,
    &ldquo;mouth&rdquo;, &ldquo;the mouth of the country&rdquo;, in allusion to the
    great river called &lsquo;Canada&rsquo; by some early writers, now the
    St. Lawrence.</p>
<p>Some trace the words Canada and canyon or cañon to
    the same Spanish origin, <i>caña</i>, &ldquo;a reed&rdquo;, of which cañada
    is a derivative and cañon an augmentative, meaning &ldquo;the
    beautiful glen or vale&rdquo;, the <i>beaupré</i> of the French, descriptive
    of much of the St. Lawrence valley.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>
<p>There is a tradition that the name originated with
    Spanish explorers who failed to find gold mines here and
    described the country by the Spanish phrase, <i>Aca nada</i>, <i>aca</i> meaning &ldquo;here&rdquo;, and <i>nada</i>, &ldquo;nothing&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Katharine Livingstone Macpherson of Montreal has
    embalmed this traditional origin in a poem, the first
    stanza of which is:</p>

    Simcoe.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Canisbay</span>: township in Nipissing district, Ontario,
    formed in 1882.</p>

    the Mowat family at Canisbay in Caithness, Scotland.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Cannington</span>: incorporated (1878), village in Ontario
    county, Ontario.</p>
<p>The first settlers located here in 1820. Among them
    was the McCaskill family and the place was known by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span> name of McCaskill&rsquo;s Mills until 1834 when it received its
    present name.</p>
<p>Cannington was named in honour of the Honourable
    George Canning, statesman and orator, born in London,
    England, in 1770 and died there in 1827. He was educated
    at Eton and Oxford and entered parliament in 1794. Mr.
    Canning was twice secretary of foreign affairs and also
    served as prime minister. When he came into power
    opposition to Napoleon seemed almost hopeless. By the
    vigour and breadth of his mind he gave new colour to
    the war and soon turned the tide against the French
    despot.</p>
<p>Canning was intensely British and a devoted adherent
    of Pitt. When he died he was buried near Pitt&rsquo;s tomb in
    Westminster Abbey.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Canonto</span>: township in Frontenac county, Ontario,

    resident at the time of the township&rsquo;s organization.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Canso</span>: strait, cape, and port in Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>The origin of the name is disputed. Haliburton
    derives the word from Spanish <i>ganso</i>, &ldquo;a goose&rdquo;; Band
    says the word is Indian, meaning &ldquo;opposite lofty hills&rdquo;.
    Some writers trace it to the French <i>campseau</i>, &ldquo;a common
    resort for ships in these waters&rdquo;.</p>

    district, Ontario. The town was incorporated in 1918. It
    is the centre of a rich mineral area. Transportation facilities
    are well provided by the Canadian National Railway.</p>
<p>The town site was laid out in 1913 by C. T. Young, of
    Toronto. Its name was suggested by Sir William
    MacKenzie and Sir Donald Mann, builders of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span> Canadian Northern Railway, now incorporated in the
    Canadian National system, in honour of Frederick Chase
    Capreol, Civil Engineer. He projected the Canadian

    Mr. Capreol was a man of much public spirit.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Caradoc</span>: township, Middlesex county, Ontario,
    formed in 1820.</p>
<p>It is said to take its name from Caer Caradoc, or
    Mount of Caractacus, in Shropshire, England. On the top
    of this hill are still to be seen the remains of an old British
    camp. History tells us that in A.D. 53 the British King
    Caractacus was defeated here by the Roman legions.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Carden</span>: township in Victoria county, Ontario, erected

    battle of Corunna in 1809.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Cardiff</span>: township in Haliburton district, Ontario,
    organized in 1862.</p>
<p>It was named after the town of Cardiff in Glamorganshire,
    Wales. The town was once surrounded by a wall,
    the remains of which may still be seen. In the Castle of
    Cardiff King Henry I. imprisoned his brother Robert,
    Duke of Normandy, from 1106 till his death in 1132.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Cardston</span>: town in southern Alberta.</p>

    of the Mormon Church in Canada. The Mormons have
    built a beautiful temple here on the same architectural
    lines as the one in Salt Lake City.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Cardwell</span>: township, Muskoka district, Ontario, erected
    in 1866.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>
<p>It was named in honour of Edward Viscount Cardwell,
    a distinguished parliamentarian of England. He was
    Secretary of the Colonies 1864-&rsquo;66. In 1868 he became
    Secretary of State for War.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Cargill</span>: village in Bruce county, Ontario, nine miles
    from Walkerton, on the C.N.R.</p>
<p>The first settlers brought the name with them from
    their old home in the parish and village of Cargill, Perthshire,
    Scotland. The parish contains burial mounds and
    other Caledonian remains. There are traces, too, of
    Roman camps, military roads and aqueducts.</p>
<p>An early form of the word is Carghill. The word is
    probably derived from Gaelic <i>càrr gill</i> (genitive of <i>geall</i>),
    meaning &ldquo;rock of the pledge&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Cariboo</span>: district and lake in British Columbia.</p>
<p>The word is another form of Caribou, so common in
    Canada as a place-name. It is of French origin and was
    given to a species of Arctic reindeer, hence the place
    frequented by the caribou.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Carillon</span>: village situated on the Ottawa River, Argenteuil
    county, Quebec, and Falls near by on the same river
    where it marks the interprovincial boundary between
    Ontario and Quebec. It is estimated that the Carillon
    Falls is capable of producing 1,000,000 of water horse-power.</p>
<p>The Carillon Falls or Rapids is the Long Sault of historical
    memory. In 1660 in this vicinity Daulac (Dollard)
    and his company of sixteen young Frenchmen wrote the
    most thrilling page in all Canadian history and saved the
    French settlements on the St. Lawrence from utter ruin.
    The site of their fight with the Iroquois is disputed.
    Opposite Carillon is Point Fortune and some claim the
    Algonquin fort, the scene of the conflict, was on a knoll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span> about a mile above this village. Others maintain it was in
    Carillon and in the heart of this village a monument has
    been erected in commemoration of the heroic band by the
    St. Jean Baptiste Society.</p>
<p>The village took its name from an officer of the
    famous Regiment de Carignan named Carrion who obtained
    a grant of land on the Lake of Two Mountains
    from the French government in 1670. Apparently by an
    error in transcription Carrion became Carillon.</p>
<p>Carillon, a French word (pronounced car-i-yon)
    means &ldquo;musical bells&rdquo;. A carillon is not, however, just
    a set of chimes. It is a set of bells accurately tuned in
    regular half-tone intervals, forming a complete chromatic
    scale, with a compass of three or four octaves and
    upward, the bells fixed immovably and rung by clappers
    controlled from a keyboard, the whole being suitably
    arranged for artistic purposes in a bell tower. The Carillon
    of fifty-three bells installed in the Victory Memorial
    Tower, Parliament Buildings, Ottawa, and rung for the
    first time on July 1st, 1927, is the largest of its kind in the
    world. There are several carillons in Canada, two in
    Toronto, one in Guelph, one in Simcoe.</p>
<p>It was on the foregoing date that Col. Charles A. Lindberg,
    the lone eagle of the Atlantic, flew the &ldquo;Spirit of St.
    Louis&rdquo;, accompanied by an escort of twelve planes, from
    Detroit to Ottawa to carry a message of good-will from
    the United States to Canada celebrating her Diamond
    Jubilee of Confederation.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Carleton</span>: county in Ontario, instituted in 1798.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Sir Guy Carleton, Lord
    Dorchester, 1724-1808. He was with General Wolfe in
    the Battle of the Plains of Abraham. In 1774 Carleton
    saved Canada for the British Empire by defeating Montgomery
    and Arnold at Quebec. He was Governor-General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span> of Canada from 1786 till 1796. Carleton county, N.B.,
    was also named in Sir Guy&rsquo;s honour.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Carling</span>: township in Parry Sound district, Ontario,
    formed in 1873.</p>
<p>It took its name from the Hon. Sir John Carling, of
    London, Ontario. For many years Mr. Carling was a
    member of the Ontario Legislature and the Dominion
    House of Commons. He was Minister of Agriculture for
    Canada, 1885-&rsquo;92.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Carlow</span>: township in Hastings county, Ontario, constituted
    in 1866.</p>
<p>It was named after Carlow, a town and a county in
    South Ireland, now known as the Irish Free State. It was
    formerly the scene of frequent strife between the Irish
    and the English.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Carman</span>: town in Manitoba, served by both the C.P.R.
    and C.N.R., about fifty-five miles south-west of Winnipeg.
    It is the centre of a good wheat-growing district.</p>
<p>The place was named in honour of the Rev. Albert
    Carman, M.A., D.D., LL.D., 1833-1917, sometime Chancellor
    of Albert College, Belleville, Ontario; Bishop of
    the Methodist Episcopal Church in Canada, 1874-&rsquo;83;
    General Superintendent of The Methodist Church in Canada
    from 1883 till the eve of his death.</p>
<p>Dr. Carman was a forceful, eloquent speaker and a
    great preacher. He was of U.E. Loyalist descent and
    possessed in a high degree the fine characteristics of these
    pioneer patriots of Canada.</p>
<p>The first inhabitant of the town-site of Carman was
    W. G. Livingston who homesteaded in 1876. He was dispossessed,
    however, by W. A. Farmer who set up a prior
    claim. About 1882 the question arose about a permanent
    name for the infant town. Two names were proposed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span> Carman and Hazeldeen. A vote of the residents was
    taken and Carman was the choice of the majority.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Carnarvon</span>: township in Manitoulin district, Ontario,
    erected in 1867.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Henry Howard Molyneux
    Herbert, Earl of Carnarvon, 1831-&rsquo;90. He was Secretary
    of State for the Colonies at this period, and introduced
    and carried through the Imperial Parliament the B.N.A.
    Act of 1867. The title of the family was taken from the
    county of Carnarvon in Wales.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Carrick</span>: township in Bruce county, Ontario. It was
    surveyed in 1850.</p>
<p>It was named after Carrick in Ayrshire, Scotland.
    Once when Robert Bruce was in seclusion in Arran he
    mistook an accidental fire on the Carrick coast for an
    appointed signal and crossed over the sea to attempt to
    regain the freedom of Scotland.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Cartwright</span>: township in Durham county, Ontario,
    formed in 1816.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Hon. Richard Cartwright
    who settled at Kingston about 1790. He was a member
    of the Executive Council of Upper Canada. Mr. Cartwright
    died in 1815. In both his public and private life
    he was held in high esteem. Sir Richard Cartwright, at
    one time Minister of Trade and Commerce for Canada,
    was his grandson. The village of Cartwright in Manitoba,
    founded in 1882, was named after him. Sir Richard
    owned the town site at that time.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Cashel</span>: township in Hastings county, Ontario, erected
    in 1860.</p>
<p>It was named after the town of Cashel, Tipperary
    county, Free State, Ireland. Just outside this city is a
    famous rock covered with the ruins of churches and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span> castles. The word Cashel is derived from Carsiol, meaning
    &ldquo;the habitation in the rock&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Cassiar</span>: land district and mountains in British Columbia.</p>
<p>The word is Indian in origin, a corruption of <i>kasha</i> or <i>kaska</i>, meaning &ldquo;a creek&rdquo;. The district contains many
    streams of water.</p>
<p>James White, F.R.S.C., in <i>Place Names&mdash;Northern
    Canada</i>, states Kaska is the name applied collectively
    to two Indian tribes living eastward of the Stikine River.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Castelneau</span>: mount, 9,800 feet, and also a glacier in
    British Columbia. They are named in honour of a
    French general in the Great War, 1914-&rsquo;18.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Cataraqui</span>: river flowing into the St. Lawrence River
    at Kingston, Frontenac county, Ontario.</p>
<p>Cataraqui is Iroquois, meaning &ldquo;where river and lake
    meet&rdquo;, applied originally only to the mouth of the tributary.
    Here in July, 1673, Frontenac and his 400 French
    officers and soldiers, in glittering arms, met the Iroquois
    chiefs in friendly council and secured their consent to the
    construction of a storehouse and fort at this strategic
    point.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Cavan</span>: township in the county of Durham, Ontario,
    surveyed in 1816.</p>
<p>It took its name from the county of Cavan, Free State,
    Ireland, from where most of its early settlers came. The
    word Cavan is said to be derived from the geographic
    term &ldquo;cave&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Cavendish</span>: township in Peterborough county, Ontario,
    erected in 1862.</p>
<p>It was named after an Englishman, Henry Cavendish,
    1731-1810. Dr. Cavendish was a scholar of high attainments
    and excellence of character. He measured the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span> density of the earth, and discovered the composition of
    water.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Cayuga</span>: the county-town of Haldimand county, Ontario.</p>
<p>It is of Indian origin, <i>gwa ugwck</i>, meaning &ldquo;where
    they take the boats out&rdquo;, the portage or carrying-place.
    The Cayuga Indians were granted lands adjacent to the
    Grand River by Governor Haldimand. Cayuga is also
    the name of a township in Haldimand county, erected in
    1835.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Chaleur</span>: inlet of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, between
    New Brunswick and Quebec.</p>
<p>It is a French word meaning &ldquo;heat&rdquo;. The bay was
    named &ldquo;la baye de Chaleur&rdquo; by Cartier who visited it in
    July, 1534. He and his sailors found the heat here oppressive,
    hence the name. Many map-makers have printed
    this name, Bay of Chaleurs.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Chambly</span>: county in Quebec, and two picturesque and
    pleasant villages (Chambly Basin and Chambly Canton)
    about one mile apart and fifteen or sixteen miles from
    Montreal.</p>
<p>They are named after Captain Jacques de Chambly,
    an officer in the famous Carignan Regiment, who constructed
    a fort here (Chambly Canton) in 1665, the remains
    of which form one of Canada&rsquo;s historic piles. In
    1672 Intendant Bagot conferred a seigniory in this district
    on Captain Chambly which he named after himself.
    The surname Chambly is evidently derived from the
    French phrase <i>champ de blé</i>, &ldquo;the field of grain&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Champlain</span>: county in Quebec and also a lake discovered
    by Champlain in 1609.</p>
<p>Samuel de Champlain (1567-1635) was already an
    eminent French navigator when he was commissioned
    in 1603 by Henry IV. of France to make settlements in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span> North America. He founded Quebec in 1608 and devoted
    the rest of his life to the welfare of New France or
    Canada. Not only did he strive to plant a permanent
    colony here for his king and country but he longed to
    spread the Gospel of Jesus among the aborigines. To this
    end he secured the coming of the first missionaries, the
    Recollets, to the Indians in Canada. The story of his life
    is one of the purest in all history. Champlain was a <i>man</i>.
    His name is still an inspiration perpetuated in the Champlain
    Society of Canada.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Charleston</span>: picturesque village and lake in Leeds
    county, Ontario, widely known as a charming summer
    resort. On visiting these waters Keats&rsquo; lines in his poem
    Endymion, opening with &ldquo;A thing of beauty is a joy forever&rdquo;
    are at once recalled.</p>
<p>At the close of the War of Independence waged between
    England and her Thirteen Colonies of America,
    1775-&rsquo;83, many U.E. Loyalists sought a new home in Canada.
    Several families settled in the neighbourhood of this
    beautiful lake and doubtless christened it Charleston,
    after the old home town of Charlestown [incorporated
    with Boston in 1874], Massachusetts, or in memory of Sir
    Henry Clinton&rsquo;s brilliant capture of Charleston, South
    Carolina, in 1780, so heartening at the time to their cause.</p>
<p>Charlestown was founded in 1629 and named in
    honour of King Charles I. Charleston was founded in
    1670 and named in honour of King Charles II.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Charlevoix</span>: county in the province of Quebec.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of the celebrated Jesuit
    Father Charlevoix who resided in Canada for some years.
    He wrote an estimable history of New France.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Charlottetown</span>: the capital of Prince Edward Island.
    It is the only city in the island.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>
<p>It was named in honour of Queen Charlotte, the consort
    of King George III. She was the daughter of Charles
    Louis, Duke of Mechlinburg. Queen Charlotte died in
    1818, leaving nine sons and six daughters. The Micmac
    Indian name is <i>Booksak</i>, meaning &ldquo;narrow passage
    between cliffs&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Chateauguay</span>: county, river, and lake in Quebec.</p>
<p>In 1673 Charles Le Moyne de Longueuil received the
    grant of a seigniory in New France from the French
    Government. He named it Chateauguay after a commune
    of this name in France. On October 26th, 1813, the
    Canadian militia 1,000 strong, under Col. de Salaberry,
    defeated an American army, 7,000 strong, under General
    Hampton, on the bank of the Chateauguay River.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Chatham</span>: city, county town of Kent county, Ontario,
    founded by Lieutenant-Governor Simcoe in 1795. In that
    year he set apart 600 acres there for a town plot.</p>
<p>It is named after Chatham, England.</p>
<p>There is also a town by the name of Chatham on the
    Miramichi River, New Brunswick.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Chats</span>: lake, island, falls, river Ottawa. The falls possess
    great potential hydro-electric power. The governments
    of Ontario and Quebec are considering their joint
    development.</p>
<p>The name is French for &ldquo;cats&rdquo;. The neighbouring
    forest was formerly the home of great numbers of wild
    cats (lynx), rats and raccoons.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Chaudière</span>: river in Quebec, and also a falls on the
    Ottawa River.</p>
<p>The word is French, meaning &ldquo;pot or big kettle, full of
    boiling water&rdquo;, descriptive of the appearance of tumbling,
    foaming water, according to some authorities.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
    <p>&ldquo;The name, (Chaudière) which is to be found over the whole
        country, (Canada) is derived not from any supposed resemblance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span> to the boiling of a kettle, but from the shape into which the perpetual
        eddy of the torrent moulds the stones. In the Chaudière
        Falls on the Ottawa, for instance, there is a countless number of
        these water-worn cauldrons.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="sign">Sir George Simpson in <i>A Journey Round the World</i>.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="bold">Chedabucto</span>: bay, Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>The word is a corruption of Micmac <i>Sedabooktook</i>,
    meaning &ldquo;a bay running far back&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Cheltenham</span>: village in Peel county, Ontario. It was
    founded in 1819 by Charles Haines, millwright, native of
    Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, England, who built a flour-mill
    here on the River Credit.</p>
<p>Its English namesake is situated on the River Chelt,
    an affluent of the Severn, and is famed for its mineral
    springs and educational advantages. The name is derived
    from Chelt and old English <i>hamme</i>, &ldquo;an enclosure&rdquo; meaning
    &ldquo;an enclosure on the River Chelt&rdquo;. Chelt is derived
    from the Roman <i>celtae</i>, people who hide in the forest.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Chidley</span>: cape at the entrance to Hudson strait.</p>
<p>It was named after Mr. John Chidley of the town of
    Chidley, Devon county, England, by his friend the navigator
    Davis, in 1587. Chidley was also a navigator and
    commanded an expedition in search of the South Pole.
    Chidley in England is now spelled Chudleigh.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Chignecto</span>: bay at the foot of the Bay of Fundy, Nova
    Scotia and New Brunswick.</p>
<p>It is a Micmac Indian word meaning &ldquo;foot cloth&rdquo;,
    referring evidently to the outline of the bay.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Chilliwack</span>: city in southern central British Columbia.</p>
<p>The first white settlers arrived in 1862 and adopted
    the Indian name of the district. The word is derived from <i>chill-a-whaak</i>, meaning &ldquo;the valley of many waters&rdquo;, descriptive
    of the many small mountain streams. This information
    was received from Wilfred H. Kipp, Postmaster of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span> the city, whose father and uncle were among the first
    white settlers.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Chinguacousy</span>: township in Peel county, Ontario,
    erected in 1819.</p>
<p>The name is a corruption of the Indian term <i>Shing-wark-ous-e-ka</i>,
    meaning &ldquo;where young pines grow&rdquo;.
    There was a noted Christian Chippewa chief named Shinguacose,
    &ldquo;The Small Pine&rdquo;, who assisted the British in the
    taking of Fort Michillimackinac in 1812. He was the son
    of a Scotch officer by a Chippewa squaw.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Chipewyan</span>: lakes, river, and Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company
    post and settlement in Alberta.</p>
<p>They are named after a Cree Indian tribe. The word
    means &ldquo;pointed skins&rdquo;, hence applied to the people who
    wear them.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Chippewa</span> or <span class="bold">Chippawa</span>: village in Welland county,
    Ontario.</p>
<p>Chippewa and Objibway seem to be different spellings
    of the same Indian words compounded, <i>adji</i>, &ldquo;voice&rdquo;, and <i>bwa</i>, &ldquo;gathering up&rdquo;, that is &ldquo;a windy fellow&rdquo;. The Objibways
    and the Mississaugas are both called by different
    writers Chippeways. These tribes occupied the shores of
    Lakes Superior and Huron, but frequented southern
    Ontario also. Their totem was the loon and bear.</p>
<p>Chippewa was formerly the Canadian terminus of an
    important ferry service and the southerly end of the
    Queenston-Chippewa portage. Recently an engineering
    feat has been performed on Chippewa creek (Welland
    River), which heretofore flowed into the Niagara River,
    by which it has been turned around and made to flow for
    four and a half miles into the new hydro-electric power
    canal.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>
<p>On the 5th of July, 1814, an engagement took place at
    Chippewa between the Americans, 4,000 strong, and a
    Canadian force of 2,000. The Canadians were forced to
    retreat, but on the 26th of July, having been reinforced
    by 800 men, the Canadians defeated the Americans in the
    ever-memorable battle of Lundy&rsquo;s Lane.</p>
<p>Chippewa is also the name of Fort William&rsquo;s beautiful
    Park of three hundred acres. It comprises part of an
    ancient Chippewa Indian reserve and is almost virgin
    forest.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Chisholm</span>: township in Nipissing district, Ontario,
    constituted in 1880.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Kenneth Chisholm, M.P.P.
    for Peel county. He was born in Toronto township, Peel
    county, in 1830, and was first elected to the Legislature
    in 1873. His ancestors were from Inverness, Scotland.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Christie</span>: township in Parry Sound district, Ontario,
    erected in 1869.</p>
<p>It took its name from Robert Christie, Inspector of
    Asylums for the Province. His father, Rev. Robert
    Christie, was a missionary to Canada from the old Secession
    Church, Scotland.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Churchill</span>: river in Saskatchewan and Manitoba, emptying
    into Hudson Bay; a lake at the head of the river,
    and a trading post at the mouth of the river. The port
    of Churchill possesses a fine natural harbour and has
    become the northern terminus of the Hudson Bay Railway.</p>
<p>The river, lake and post were named in honour of
    John Churchill (1650-1722), first Duke of Marlborough,
    Governor of the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company, 1685-&rsquo;91.</p>
<p>This river has been known as &ldquo;English&rdquo;, &ldquo;Beaver&rdquo; and
    &ldquo;Missinipi&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>
<p>English because the English traders ascended it to
    trade with the Indians; Beaver, from the numerous
    beaver on it at one time; Missinipi, the Indian name
    meaning &ldquo;great water&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Churchville</span>: pleasant village on Credit River, Peel
    county, Ontario.</p>
<p>It was so called from one of the first settlers, Mr.
    Orange Church.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Clancy</span>: township in Nipissing district, Ontario,
    formed in 1891.</p>
<p>It took its name from Patrick Clancy who was an
    effective member of the Legislature from 1883 to 1894.
    At a later date Mr. Clancy represented Bothwell Riding
    in the House of Commons.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Clara</span>: township in Renfrew county, Ontario, erected
    in 1863.</p>
<p>The origin of the name is unknown. All enquiries
    among old residents and elsewhere have proved futile. It
    may have been named in honour of a local lady to whom
    the surveyor was indebted for kindnesses. Tennyson&rsquo;s
    Clara has been suggested. Atmospheric conditions may
    have appealed to the surveying party&mdash;<i>aura clara</i>&mdash;clear
    air.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Clarence</span>: township in Russell county, Ontario. It was
    erected in 1798.</p>
<p>It took its name from Prince William Henry, Duke of
    Clarence, afterward King William IV. This king reigned
    from 1830 to 1837. He was a son of George III. He
    joined the navy in his youth and most of his life was
    spent on the sea. He was a great favourite with his
    people. The sailor King &ldquo;walked in London streets with
    his umbrella under his arm and frankly shook hands with
    old acquaintances.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Clarendon</span>: township in Frontenac county, Ontario,
    formed in 1822.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of George William Frederick
    Villiers, fourth Earl of Clarendon, 1800-&rsquo;70. He was a
    distinguished parliamentarian, having been three times
    Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p>The title of the family was derived from Clarendon
    Park near Salisbury. Here Henry II., in 1164, called
    together the Peers and Prelates of the Realm in council.
    They enacted the &ldquo;Constitution of Clarendon&rdquo;, which
    made the clergy subject to the civil courts. The opposition
    of Thomas à Becket led to his murder in Canterbury
    Cathedral.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Clarke</span>: township in Durham county, Ontario, organized
    in 1792.</p>
<p>It was named after Major-General Alured Clarke,
    Lieut.-Governor of Lower Canada at this period. The
    name was, doubtless, suggested by his friend Simcoe who
    was then Lieut.-Governor of Upper Canada. Clarke
    achieved distinction both as an administrator and a soldier.
    He held the rank of field-marshal in the army when
    he died in 1832.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Clinton</span>: township in Lincoln county, Ontario, formed
    in 1792.</p>
<p>The name was derived from Glimpton in Oxford, England.
    This manor was conferred by William the Conqueror
    on one of his followers. Several members of the
    Clinton family rose to high rank in the army. This township
    was probably named after Sir Henry Clinton. He
    was commander, for several years, of the British forces in
    the war of independence with the United States of
    America. History awarded him both high praise and
    bitter criticism for his part therein.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>
<p>Clinton is also the name of a town in Huron county,
    Ontario. Tradition says the name was suggested by Mr.
    William Rattenbury, one of the earliest settlers, who
    came about 1880 from the estate of the Earl of Clinton in
    Devonshire, England, in honour of this nobleman.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Coaticook</span>: branch of the St. Francis River, Quebec.</p>
<p>It is derived from two Abenakis Indian words, <i>koa</i>,
    pine, and <i>tegw</i>, a river, that is &ldquo;the pine river&rdquo;. When it
    received its name the banks were studded with stately
    pine trees. Coaticook is also the name of a town on the
    banks of the river in Stanstead county.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Cobalt</span>: town in Temiskaming district, Ontario.</p>
<p>It took its name from the metal, cobalt, found in
    abundance in this locality in conjunction with other valuable
    metals.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Cobequid</span>: bay, far eastern end of Fundy, Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>The word is Micmac Indian meaning &ldquo;the end of the
    rushing waters&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Coboconk</span>: village in Victoria county, Ontario.</p>
<p>The word is a corruption of the Indian term <i>kakapikang</i>,
    meaning &ldquo;high fall&rdquo;, according to Dr. G. M.
    Grant. Others translate it by &ldquo;swift water&rdquo;, which
    obtained there before the mill-dam was erected for industrial
    purposes. There is a fall, too, on the stream.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Cobourg</span>: town beautifully situated on &ldquo;old Ontario&rsquo;s
    strand&rdquo; in Northumberland county, Ontario. Its village
    name was Amherst in honour of General Jeffrey Amherst,
    Commander-in-Chief at the taking of Louisburg in 1758.</p>
<p>The name of Amherst gave way to Cobourg on the
    announcement that Queen Victoria was to marry the
    Prince of Coburg-Gotha. The spelling of the town&rsquo;s name
    has been enlarged since then to Cobourg.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>
<p>For many years Cobourg was a University town.
    Upper Canada Academy was founded here in 1832. In
    1841 it was erected into the University of Victoria College
    by an Act of Incorporation obtained from the Legislature
    of United Canada. In 1892 Victoria federated with
    the Provincial University and removed to Toronto.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Cocagne</span>: harbour, river, island, and town, Kent
    county, N.B.</p>
<p>The word is of French origin. It means &ldquo;plenty,
    abundance of life&rsquo;s necessities&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Cochrane</span>: town in Temiskaming district, Ontario, incorporated
    in 1909. It is the northern terminus of the
    Temiskaming and Northern Ontario Railway, the point
    where this railway connects with Canadian National Railways.
    The T. and N.O. was completed to Cochrane in November,
    1908, at which time the town-site was laid out
    and the first sale of lots took place.</p>
<p>The town is named after the late Hon. Francis Cochrane
    who was at that time (1908) Minister of Lands,
    Forests and Mines in the Ontario Government. On the
    defeat of the Laurier Administration in 1911 Mr. Cochrane
    accepted office in the Borden Cabinet as Minister of
    Railways and Canals. He was a man of character, industry
    and ability.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Cockburn Island</span>: township in Manitoulin district, constituted
    in 1821.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Lieut.-Col. Francis Cockburn,
    Quartermaster-General to the British Forces here
    at this period. He rendered valuable military services to
    Canada. Col. Cockburn accompanied Governor-General
    Dalhousie in 1821 upon a tour of inspection by water from
    Montreal through the St. Lawrence River and Great
    Lakes to Sault Ste. Marie, thence by French River, Lake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span> Nipissing and the Ottawa River to Montreal. He made a
    full and informing report on these water-ways and submitted
    a plan for their defence.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Colborne</span>: township in Huron county, Ontario, erected
    in 1830.</p>
<p>It took its name from Sir John Colborne, Lord Seaton,
    1778-1863. He achieved distinction both as a soldier and
    an administrator. He was Lieut.-Governor of Upper Canada.
    Sir John Colborne took a deep interest in education.
    He was the founder of Upper Canada College in Toronto.
    There is a village of Colborne, also named in his honour,
    in Northumberland county, Ontario. His name is commemorated,
    too, in Port Colborne, Welland county,
    Ontario.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Colchester</span>: township in Essex county, Ontario, formed
    in 1792.</p>
<p>It took its name from the city of Colchester, in Essex
    county, England. It was a famous fighting ground for
    Romans and Britons, for Saxons and Danes, for Cavaliers
    and Roundheads. The word Colchester is clearly of
    Roman origin, derived from Colne, the name of the river
    on which the city is situated, and <i>castra</i>, a camp. This
    name is also embalmed in Colchester county, Nova Scotia.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Coldwater</span>: village in Simcoe county, Ontario.</p>
<p>In 1830 the Government established a Post Office here
    for the convenience of the military department engaged
    on the trail from Barrie to Gloucester Bay. At first the
    name was Colewater in honour of Sir John Colborne,
    Governor-General of Canada, 1829-&rsquo;36. The present name,
    taken from the river which flows through the village
    known to the Indians as <i>Gis-si-nan-se-bing</i>, meaning &ldquo;cold
    river or water&rdquo;, soon displaced the former in the minds of
    the settlers.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Coleraine</span>: post village in Peel county, Ontario, and
    also post village in Megantic county, Quebec. Both are
    named after Coleraine, county of Londonderry, North
    Ireland.</p>
<p>There is an interesting story about the origin of Coleraine
    told in the <i>Tripartite Life of St. Patrick</i>. Madslua,
    an Irish chieftain, entertained St. Patrick on one of his
    travels through northern Ireland and offered him a piece
    of land on the Bann River in Londonderry on which to
    build a church. When the saint and the chief went to
    look it over, some boys were amusing themselves by setting
    fire to the ferns (dead) with which the land was
    covered. From this incident arose the name, <i>cuil</i>, &ldquo;a
    corner or angle&rdquo;, and <i>rathain</i>, &ldquo;ferns&rdquo;, that is cuil-rathain,
    &ldquo;a corner of ferns&rdquo;, altered during the succeeding
    centuries to Coleraine.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Collingwood</span>: township in Grey county, Ontario,
    erected in 1840.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Lord Collingwood, 1750-1810.
    He took to the sea at the age of eleven with his
    uncle, Admiral Braithwaite, at one time Commander of
    the frigate <i>Shannon</i>. Collingwood distinguished himself
    at the victory of Cape St. Vincent. He was second in command
    at the memorable battle of Trafalgar in 1805 and
    at the death of Nelson, Collingwood took command of the
    fleet. The town of Collingwood also bears this sailor&rsquo;s
    honoured name.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Colpoy&rsquo;s Bay</span>: arm of Georgian Bay, Ontario.</p>
<p>This bay was named in honour of Sir John Colpoy, an
    admiral in the British Navy. The name was bestowed
    by Captain Bayfield during his survey of Lake Huron and
    Georgian Bay. Prior to this the bay was called Sturgeon
    Bay and is so named on a map now in the Department of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span> Archives, Ottawa, prepared in 1792 for Lieut.-Governor
    Simcoe. See <i>History of the County of Bruce</i>.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Conger</span>: township in Parry Sound district, Ontario,
    surveyed in 1880.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Mr. P. D. Conger, formerly
    of Prince Edward county, 1830-&rsquo;85. He was a citizen of
    Toronto for some years before his death. The Conger
    family were U.E. Loyalists. They settled in Prince
    Edward in 1797. Stephen Conger gave the ground and
    material for the Methodist Church near Picton, constructed
    in 1809.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Consecon</span>: charming lake and picturesque village in
    Prince Edward county, Ontario.</p>
<p>The name is Mississauga Indian, meaning &ldquo;pickerel&rdquo;,
    a fish abounding in this lake. The word pickerel is a
    diminutive of pike.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Copper Cliff</span>: town in Sudbury district, Ontario.</p>
<p>It is in the heart of a great copper producing region,
    hence the origin of the appropriate name.</p>
<p>The International Nickel Company of Canada have
    smelters in Copper Cliff. They cover many acres of
    ground. The crude ore is a combination of nickel, copper,
    sulphur, and iron. After being crushed the ore is roasted,
    which drives out in smoke about twenty per cent. of the
    sulphur. The workmen use rubber nose caps to protect
    their lungs from the fumes. The country about the town
    is like a desert. Before the smelters were established it
    was a green forest. The change is due to the sulphur that
    comes from the ore and which kills all vegetation.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Coppermine</span>: river in Mackenzie district, flowing into
    the Arctic Ocean.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>
<p>It was named in 1771 by the famous Arctic traveller
    and explorer Samuel Hearne, 1745-&rsquo;92, after the rich
    copper mines reported on its banks.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Cornwall</span>: township (1797) and a town in Stormont
    county, Ontario.</p>
<p>They take their name from Cornwall county, England.
    The title Duke of Cornwall has been borne by the eldest
    son of the reigning sovereign since the time of the
    renowned Black Prince whose tomb is in Canterbury
    Cathedral. This name was selected, no doubt, in honour
    of the Prince of Wales of the period, afterwards King
    George IV.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Couchiching</span>: lake in Ontario. It forms the connection
    between Lake Simcoe and the Severn River by which
    these lakes discharge into Georgian Bay.</p>
<p>The word is of Indian origin and the generally
    accepted meaning is &ldquo;outlet&rdquo;. It is to be noted, however,
    that Couchiching and Chinguacousy seem to be the same
    word with the syllables reversed. Chinguacousy, according
    to most authorities, means &ldquo;a pinery&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Courtenay</span>: city in B.C., on Comox harbour, Vancouver
    Island.</p>
<p>It was named after the river on the banks of which it
    is situated. The river took its name from Captain Courtenay,
    H.M.S. <i>Constance</i>, on the Pacific Station, 1846-&rsquo;49.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Cowichan</span>: bay, river, head, village, Vancouver island,
    B.C.</p>
<p>This word is the name of a tribe of Indians who dwelt
    in this vicinity in large numbers in early days. In the
    language of the Cowichan tribe it means &ldquo;between
    streams&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Cramahe</span>: township in Northumberland county,
    Ontario, surveyed in 1792.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>
<p>It was named after Hector Theophilus Cramahe, a
    Swiss Protestant, secretary to General Murray who became
    commander-in-chief of the British forces at Quebec
    on the death of Wolfe, Plains of Abraham, September 13,
    1759. Cramahe administered the government with ability
    and discernment during Sir Guy Carleton&rsquo;s absence from
    Canada, 1770-&rsquo;74.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Cranbrook</span>: city in southern B.C.</p>
<p>It was named in 1885 by Colonel James Baker, Minister
    of Mines and Education for the province, after his
    old home town, Cranbrook, Kent county, England.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Credit</span>: river in Peel county, Ontario, emptying into
    Lake Ontario.</p>
<p>It was so called because in former times the fur-traders
    met the Indians on its banks and delivered to them
    on <i>credit</i> the goods they required for the chase and for
    which, in the following year, the traders received the
    value in good measure. Its picturesque scenery is
    embalmed in literature in Mrs. Jameson&rsquo;s <i>Sketches in
    Canada</i> of 1837.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Creemore</span>: village in Simcoe county, Ontario.</p>
<p>When a cluster of homes began to grow here one of the
    residents asked Senator J. R. Gowan, &ldquo;Simcoe&rsquo;s grand old
    man&rdquo;, to suggest a name. He coined the word from the
    Gaelic <i>cree mohr</i>, meaning &ldquo;big heart&rdquo;. It pleased the
    kindly Scottish settlers and was readily accepted. The
    post office was opened in 1854 but the village was founded
    some years before.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Croft</span>: township in Parry Sound district, Ontario,
    organized in 1871.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Professor Henry Holmes
    Croft, D.C.L. He was born in London, England, in 1820.
    Having shown superior ability for chemistry in his uni<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>versity
    course, Mr. Croft received in 1842 an appointment
    to the Chair of Chemistry in King&rsquo;s College now the University
    of Toronto, Toronto. Professor Croft achieved
    distinction in his special department of education. He
    contributed largely to agricultural chemistry in Canada.
    Professor Croft retired in 1879.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Crosby</span>: township in Leeds county, Ontario, erected
    in 1798.</p>
<p>The origin of its name is somewhat uncertain. There
    are several villages by the name of Crosby in England
    after any one of which it may have been named. On the
    other hand it is probable the township was named after
    Mr. Brass Crosby, Lord Mayor of London in 1771 and for
    some time M.P. for Honiton, Devonshire, England.
    Lieut.-Governor Simcoe may have suggested his friend&rsquo;s
    name.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Crowland</span>: township in Welland county, Ontario,
    formed in 1788.</p>
<p>It took its name from a town of ancient date in Lincolnshire,
    England. The spelling of the word on most
    maps of England is Croyland. There is a great curiosity
    here in the triangular bridge under which pass the waters
    of Welland, Nene and Catwater streams. It was erected
    in 941.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Crow&rsquo;s Nest</span>: mountain pass, river, lake and village in
    southern Alberta.</p>
<p>The origin of the name is somewhat uncertain. Some
    maintain that it is a translation of an Indian word meaning
    &ldquo;the nesting place of the crows&rdquo;, applied at first to the
    timbered, rocky top of a prominent hill near the entrance
    to Crow&rsquo;s Nest Pass.</p>
<p>Other authorities state the name commemorates a
    great slaughter of Crow Indians from the United States<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span> by the Blackfeet Bloods and Piegans. The scene of the
    battle was hard by what is now known as Crow&rsquo;s Nest
    Mountain.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Culross</span>: township in Bruce county, Ontario, organized
    in 1850.</p>
<p>It was named after the town of Culross, Firth of
    Forth, Fifeshire, Scotland. This burgh was celebrated
    for its girdles (iron bread plates), salt-pans and coal
    mines.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Cumberland</span>: county in Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>It took its name from Cumberland, north of England
    mining county. Cumberland district in B.C. was so
    named by James Dunsmuir in 1891, owing to the discovery
    of an extensive mineral region there.</p>
<p>Cumberland township in Russell county, Ontario,
    erected in 1798, was named in honour of Prince Ernest
    Augustus, Duke of Cumberland, fifth son of King George
    III.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Dalhousie</span>: township in Lanark county, Ontario,
    formed in 1823, a town on Chaleur Bay, N.B., and a village
    in Soulanges district, Quebec.</p>
<p>They were named in honour of George Ramsay, 9th
    Earl of Dalhousie, Lieut.-Governor of Nova Scotia, 1816-&rsquo;20,
    Governor-General of Canada, 1820-&rsquo;28. He was the
    founder of Dalhousie College, Halifax, during his term as
    Lieut.-Governor of Nova Scotia. As Governor-General
    of Canada he had to contend with great difficulties and
    much opposition. For the most part, however, the people
    appreciated his outstanding ability and irreproachable
    character. Dalhousie was a distinguished soldier, and
    when he left Canada he was appointed Commander-in-Chief
    of the forces in India.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Dalrymple</span>: lake in Victoria and Ontario counties, province
    of Ontario.</p>
<p>It was named after Dalrymple post office and the post

    in 1866.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Dr. John Dalton, 1766-1844,
    the famous English chemist. His favourite studies
    were mathematics and the physical sciences. Dalton
    became a teacher at Manchester and while there
    announced the atomic theory in chemistry.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Dandurand</span>: canton or township in the counties of
    Saint Maurice and Champlain, Quebec.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of the Hon. M. Raoul Dandurand,
    member of the Canadian Senate.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Danforth</span>: district in the north-eastern part of the
    city of Toronto and of a station there of the Canadian
    National Railway.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>
<p>Both take their name from Danforth Avenue which
    the district adjoins. The name of the avenue commemorates
    Mr. Asa Danforth who had the contract from the
    Upper Canada government to construct a road from
    York to the Bay of Quinte, 1799-1800. The Danforth
    road was part of the great military highway initiated by
    Simcoe, from Sandwich to Montreal. See <i>Dundas</i>.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Darling</span>: township in Lanark county, Ontario, surveyed
    in 1823.</p>
<p>It was probably named after Col. H. C. Darling, military
    secretary to Lord Dalhousie, Governor-General of
    Canada, 1820-&rsquo;28. In 1822 this Colonel Darling made a
    report to the Government on the military settlements in
    Lanark.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Darlington</span>: village and also township, erected in 1792,
    in Durham county, Ontario.</p>
<p>They were named after Darlington in Durham county,
    England, the old home of some of the first settlers.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Dauphin</span>: lake, river and town in Manitoba.</p>
<p>One of the younger Verendryes founded Fort Dauphin
    on the shores of the lake in 1741. He named it after the

    The name was attached later to the lake and river.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Davis</span>: strait connecting Baffin Bay with the Atlantic
    Ocean.</p>
<p>It was named after the navigator, John Davis, 1554-1605.
    He ranks with Gilbert and Raleigh among the
    Arctic explorers of Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign. The three
    grew up in the same Devonian neighbourhood. Davis not
    only discovered the strait which bears his name but also
    the Falkland islands while seeking a passage through the
    strait now called Magellan.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Dawn</span>: township in Lambton county, Ontario, organized
    in 1830.</p>
<p>The origin of the name is uncertain. Some freed
    slaves from Virginia settled there and it has been suggested
    that the name came from their Dawn of Liberty.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Dawson</span>: the capital city of the Yukon Territory.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of George M. Dawson, C.M.G.,
    sometime director of the Geological Survey of Canada,
    and explorer of the Stikine, Dease, Francis, Pelly and
    Lewis Rivers of the Yukon.</p>
<p>Dawson is also the name of a township in Manitoulin
    district, Ontario.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Simon James Dawson, C.E.,
    who was born in Scotland and came to Canada when a
    youth. He was employed by the Government to direct the
    construction of public highways, including the Dawson
    route to the Red River, 1868-&rsquo;70. In 1875 Mr. Dawson
    was elected to the Ontario Legislature for Algoma. From
    1878 to 1890 he was a member of the House of Commons
    for the same constituency. Mr. Dawson did much to
    encourage colonization in unoccupied districts by his
    policy of good roads.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Deacon</span>: township in Nipissing district, Ontario,
    formed in 1886.</p>
<p>It was named after Thomas Deacon who represented
    North Renfrew in the Ontario Legislature, 1871-&rsquo;79. Mr.
    Deacon was a member of the legal profession and was
    appointed judge of Renfrew county in 1895.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Dease</span>: lake and river in the Cassiar district, B.C., and
    of a river and bay in Mackenzie district.</p>
<p>They are named after Peter Warren Dease, at one
    time chief factor of New Caledonia (together with Vancouver
    Island named British Columbia by Queen Victoria<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span> in 1868) for the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company. He accompanied
    Franklin on his expedition of 1825-&rsquo;27.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Delaware</span>: township in Middlesex county, Ontario,
    erected in 1798.</p>
<p>It was named after an Indian tribe who removed from
    the United States and settled on the Thames River in
    Upper Canada. The name comes from Lord De la Warr
    or Warre, Governor of the English colony of Virginia
    in the early years of the 17th century.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Delta</span>: picturesque village in Leeds county, Ontario.</p>
<p>The first name of this place was Stevenstown after
    Stevens, the first settler here. When a stone flour-mill
    was built about 1812&mdash;the first in the county&mdash;the name
    was changed to Stone Mill. Later this name gave way to
    Beverley after the late Chief-Justice Sir John Beverley
    Robinson. About 1886 the present name of Delta was
    adopted.</p>
<p>A river or creek (mill) one mile long connects upper
    and lower Beverley Lakes. The village is situated on an
    island at the mouth of the upper lake and source of the
    lower lake, hence its name, Delta. See <i>Beverley</i>.</p>
<p>This name (delta) is given to land (alluvial deposits)
    of a triangular shape resembling the Greek capital letter
    &#916; [Greek: D], formed at the mouth or mouths of rivers.</p>
<p>The most historic and most pronounced delta is that of
    the Nile. It was here that the term was first applied
    geographically. It is not only appropriately named in this
    instance but is distinguished by being the only village
    called Delta in the British Empire Gazeteers.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Denbigh</span>: township in Addington county, Ontario,
    formed in 1859.</p>
<p>It was named after Denbighshire in Wales, which has
    large iron and coal mines. The town of Denbigh was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span> granted to one Hugh Lacy, Earl of Lincoln, by King
    Edward I. He erected a fine castle in the town and surrounded
    it by a wall for defensive purposes.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Derby</span>: township in Grey county, Ontario, was organized
    in 1842.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of the Earl of Derby of the
    period. The title was taken from the city of Derby in
    Derbyshire, England. It is an enterprising city situated
    on the Derwent River. The name is probably derived
    from the British word <i>dur</i>, meaning water, and Anglo-Saxon <i>by</i>, a village or town.</p>
<p><span class="bold">De Rottenburg</span>: island, Brock group, St. Lawrence
    River.</p>
<p>It was named after Major-General Francis, Baron de

    Canadian officer of French extraction, war of
    1812-&rsquo;14. (See Chateauguay.)</p>
<p><span class="bold">Detroit</span>: river connecting Lake St. Clair with Lake
    Erie.</p>
<p>It was named by early French explorers. The word
    means narrows or strait.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Devine</span>: township in Nipissing district, Ontario, surveyed
    in 1884.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Thomas Devine, P.L.S.,
    who entered the Department of Crown Lands, Upper Canada,
    in 1846. He became Deputy Surveyor-General in
    1872. During his service he brought out many valuable
    maps of Canada. After thirty-three years of service Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span> Devine retired in 1879. His work was recognized by the
    Royal Geographic Society of London which elected him a
    Fellow. He died in Montreal in 1888.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Diamond</span>: bold promontory around which the romantic
    city of Quebec nestles. This mountain eminence is
    crowned by battlements, Canada&rsquo;s Gibraltar. Taken all
    in all it is the most alluring and historic spot in the
    Dominion.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
    <p>&ldquo;Cape Diamond abounds with very fine specimens of quartz, or
        rock-crystals, generally pentagons. I have, myself, in walking on
        the banks of the river at the foot of the rocks, found many of them.
        They are discovered from the brilliancy of their reflecting surfaces:
        they sparkle like the diamond, and hence the place had its name.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="bold">Dickens</span>: township in Nipissing district, Ontario. It
    was organized in 1894.</p>
<p>This township was named in honour of Charles
    Dickens, the English novelist, 1812-&rsquo;70. Owing to straitened
    circumstances his father lived for a time in one of
    the poorer districts of London. The youth&rsquo;s keen observation
    of the people about him here furnished him with
    the characters so realistically described in his novels.
    While a reporter on the <i>Morning Chronicle</i> his &ldquo;Sketches
    by Boz&rdquo; brought him into public notice.</p>

<p>Dickens&rsquo; novels have been read almost universally.
    Their animation, drollery, and pathos make them compellingly
    popular. Queen Victoria offered him a baronetcy.
    At his death he was buried in the Poets&rsquo; Corner of Westminster
    Abbey.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Dickson</span>: township in Nipissing district, Ontario,
    formed in 1888.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>
<p>It was named after James Dickson, P.L.S., who was
    born in Scotland, 1834, and came to Upper Canada in his
    youth. He surveyed much unorganized territory for the
    Ontario Government. Mr. Dickson was employed in the
    formation of Algonquin Park, and was appointed one of
    the Park Commissioners.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Digby</span>: county and town in Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>They are named after the Honourable Robert Digby,
    British Admiral, who had charge of the transportation
    of U.E. Loyalists to this district in 1783.</p>
<p>Digby is also the name of a township in Victoria
    county, Ontario, erected in 1860. It was named in
    honour of Captain Digby who won high commendation
    for his part in the swift and orderly embarkation of the
    British Army after the battle of Corunna. The Digbys

    for several centuries. The family seat is at Sherbourne
    in Dorsetshire, England.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Don</span>: river flowing into Lake Ontario, York county,
    Ontario.</p>
<p>The name was given by Lieut.-Governor Simcoe and
    was suggested by his wife after the Don river in England.
    The Indian name was Wonscoteonach, meaning &ldquo;back
    burnt lands&rdquo;, that is, the river flowing down from the
    back burnt country. The term was descriptive, referring
    probably to Poplar Plains to the north, often swept by
    casual fires in the woods.</p>
<p><span class="bold">D&rsquo;or</span>: cape, Cumberland county, Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>It was so called by early French explorers who mistook
    native copper for gold. Cap d&rsquo;Or signifies in English
    &ldquo;Cape of gold&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Dorchester</span>: county in Quebec, and a township in
    Elgin county, Ontario, formed in 1798.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>
<p>They were named in honour of Sir Guy Carleton, Lord
    Dorchester, Governor-General of Canada from 1786 to
    1796. The title is taken from the town of Dorchester of
    picturesque scenery in Dorsetshire, England.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Douai</span>: mountain 10,200 feet high, Rockies, Alberta
    and British Columbia.</p>
<p>It was named after the fortified town of Douai in

    on October 18, 1918, by Canadian troops in conjunction
    with the Allies.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Douglas</span>: mountain 11,017 feet high, headwaters of
    Red Deer River, Rocky Mountains, Alberta.</p>
<p>It was named after David Douglas, Scottish botanist,
    who crossed the Rockies in 1827. It is also the name of a
    mount north of Victoria city, B.C. This elevation was
    named in honour of Sir James Douglas, Hudson&rsquo;s Bay
    Company, Governor of Vancouver Island, 1851-&rsquo;58, Crown
    Governor of British Columbia, 1858-&rsquo;64. Sir James gave
    the mount and surrounding district to the city of Victoria.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Douro</span>: township in Peterborough county, Ontario,
    constituted in 1821.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Arthur Wellesley, Duke of
    Wellington, England&rsquo;s greatest military leader. In 1808
    he received chief command of the Peninsular army in
    Portugal and drove Marshal Soult out of that country.
    Wellesley&rsquo;s brilliant success over the French at the Douro
    River won for him the title, Baron Douro.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Dover</span>: township in Kent county, Ontario, erected in
    1794.</p>
<p>It took its name from Dover, a seaport in Kent county,
    England (for an allied meaning of this term, see <i>Port
    Dover</i>.) The name is British in origin, meaning &ldquo;a steep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span> place&rdquo;. It possesses a strong fortress and extensive barracks,
    both of ancient date. Dover is now a favourite
    watering-place during the bathing season.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Downie</span>: township in Perth county, Ontario, organized
    in 1830.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Mr. Robert Downie, M.P.,
    one of the projectors of the Canada Land Company.</p>
<p>Downie is also the name of an island, Navy group, St.
    Lawrence River, Leeds county, Ontario.</p>
<p>It was named after Commodore George Downie, R.N.,
    who was killed in action on Lake Champlain, September
    11, 1814.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Dresden</span>: flourishing town in Kent county, Ontario,
    twelve miles north of Chatham.</p>
<p>This town took its name from Dresden, capital city of
    Saxony in Germany. The old Saxon city is a centre of
    art. Hardly any place in the world has such a valuable
    collection of paintings and sculpture.</p>
<p>In an old cemetery near the Canadian Dresden stands
    a monument which was erected years ago over the grave
    of Rev. Josiah Henson, the man after whom Harriet
    Beecher Stowe modelled the hero character of her immortal
    &ldquo;Uncle Tom&rsquo;s Cabin&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Drumbo</span>: village in Oxford county, Ontario.</p>
<p>It took its name from Drumbo, County Down, Ireland.
    The word is Gaelic Celtic, meaning &ldquo;a hill ridge like a

<p><span class="bold">Drummond</span>: county in Quebec, and township in
    Lanark county, Ontario, formed in 1816.</p>
<p>They are named in honour of General Sir Gordon
    Drummond, 1771-1854. He came to Canada in 1813 as
    second in command to Sir George Prevost. General Drummond
    distinguished himself at the battle of Lundy&rsquo;s Lane<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span> where he was severely wounded. When Sir George
    Prevost was called home in 1814 Drummond succeeded
    him as Commander of the forces and Administrator <i>pro
    tem</i>, of the Government of the Canadas, a position he
    held until the arrival in 1816 of Governor Sir John Coape
    Sherbrooke.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Dudley</span>: township in Haliburton district, Ontario,
    erected in 1860.</p>
<p>It was probably named after the town of Dudley in
    Worcestershire, England. This town possesses the ruins
    of an historic castle said to have been erected in the 8th
    century by Dudo, a Saxon chief, hence the origin of the
    name. When Queen Mary came to the throne this castle
    was the property of a notable character, John of Dudley,
    Earl of Warbeck and Duke of Northumberland. His son,
    Lord Guildford Dudley, married the accomplished Lady
    Jane Grey.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Duff</span>: mountain 7,170 feet high, on the international
    boundary, British Columbia and Alaska.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Dufferin</span>: county in Ontario, formed in 1875 out of
    townships cut off from the counties of Simcoe and Wellington.</p>
<p>It was named after the Right Honourable Frederick
    Temple Blackwood, 1826-1902, made Marquis of Dufferin
    and Ava in 1888, but had succeeded to his father&rsquo;s title,
    Baron Dufferin, in 1841. The dignity of Dufferin was
    taken from the barony or territorial division of Dufferin,
    County Down, Ireland. The title Ava was taken from
    the province of Ava, British India, formerly the kingdom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span> of Burma, annexed to the Indian Empire during the viceroyship
    of Dufferin.</p>
<p>The Marquis was descended from a distinguished
    family and was educated at Eton and Oxford. He was a
    powerful and graceful orator, a diplomat, a statesman
    and a litterateur of high rank. During his career Dufferin
    was British Ambassador at all the important capitals of
    Europe. He was Governor-General of Canada from
    1872-&rsquo;78, and Viceroy of India from 1884-&rsquo;88. He made
    a voyage of 6,000 miles in his yacht <i>The Foam</i>, in 1853,
    to Iceland, and soon after published <i>Letters from High
    Latitudes</i> which established his standing in literature.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Dumfries</span> (North): township in Waterloo county, Ontario,
    formed in 1816.</p>
<p>It took its name from Dumfries, on the river Nith,
    Scotland. In 1816 the Hon. William Dickson, of Niagara,
    purchased 90,000 acres of land along the Grand River
    which he named Dumfries after his home town in Scotland.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Dumfries</span> (South): township in Norfolk county, has
    the same origin.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Dummer</span>: township in Peterborough county, Ontario,
    organized in 1821.</p>
<p>It was named after the Hon. William Dummer Powell,
    Chief-Justice of Upper Canada. Owing to his legal education
    and natural ability his influence in state affairs in
    the new province during the first quarter of the nineteenth
    century was quite supreme. He and Bishop John
    Strachan were the unofficial advisers of the Lieutenant-Governors
    of the period.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Duncan</span>: city on the south-eastern coast of Vancouver
    Island, B.C.</p>
<p>Prior to 1887 it was known as Alderlea. In that year
    the Esquimalt and Nanaimo Railway opened a station<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span> there and since then it has been known as Duncan&rsquo;s Station
    or Duncan after the late William Chalmers Duncan, a
    pioneer of 1862.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Dundas</span>: county, town, and street in Ontario; also a
    group of islands and a point in the coast district of B.C.</p>
<p>Apparently all are named after the Right Hon. Henry
    Dundas, Treasurer of the British Navy from 1783 to 1801.
    The first Lieut.-Governor of Upper Canada, General John
    Graves Simcoe (1791-&rsquo;96), had an extensive official correspondence <i>re</i> his plans with Treasurer Dundas, and
    when he projected a military road across the province
    from east to west Simcoe named it Dundas Street. Only
    part of this highway still retains the name.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Dungannon</span>: township in Hastings county, Ontario,
    erected in 1857.</p>
<p>It took its name from the town of Dungannon in the
    county of Tyrone, Ireland.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Dunn</span>: township in Haldimand county, Ontario,
    formed in 1830.</p>
<p>It was probably named in honour of Hon. John Henry
    Dunn who was Receiver-General of Upper Canada for
    many years between 1824 and 1844. He represented for
    a term the city of Toronto in the Legislative Assembly.
    Mr. Dunn was a man of high character and moderate
    views. He died in London, England, in 1854. Dunnville,
    thriving town in this county, is also named in memory of
    Mr. Dunn.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Dunnegan</span>: Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company post, Peace River,
    Alberta.</p>
<p>A. McLeod of Skye founded the post, naming it after
    the castle of the McLeods in Scotland.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Dunsmuir</span>: group of islands in Ladysmith harbour,

    Dunsmuir, founder of the town of Ladysmith, B.C. He
    died in 1920.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Dunwich</span>: Elgin county, Ontario, was organized into a
    township in 1792.</p>
<p>It took its name from Dunwich in Suffolk, England.
    It was a thriving port in the time of Edward I., but,
    being gradually undermined by the sea, it is now almost
    wholly submerged.</p>
<p>The origin of Dunwich is doubtful. Some think it
    is from Celtic, <i>dun</i>, fort and <i>wich</i>, a station; others derive
    it from Welsh <i>dwfu</i>, deep and <i>wich</i>, a station.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Durham</span>: county in Ontario, was named in 1792 after
    Durham county, England. There is also a town of Durham
    in Bruce county, Ontario.</p>

    and <i>holme</i>, meadow, descriptive of the situation of the
    English city.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Dutton</span>: enterprising village in Elgin county, Ontario.</p>
<p>It came into existence with the Canada Southern Railway
    in 1872, Mr. A. J. Leitch was the first Postmaster

<p>The village was named after one of the civil engineers
    who surveyed the line for the Canada Southern (now part
    of the Michigan Central Railway System). Information
    received from Colin St. Clair Leitch, K.C., of St. Thomas.</p>

<p>It took its name from Fort Edmonton, built in 1795,
    twenty miles farther down the North Saskatchewan

    It was named after Edmonton, near London, England,
    probably as a compliment to John Prudens, Sutherland&rsquo;s
    clerk, who was born there. This fort was destroyed
    by the Indians in 1807. A new fort of the same name
    was built in 1808 on the slope of the high bank within
    the limits of the present city of Edmonton. Later the
    word fort fell into disuse and when the first post office
    was opened on February 1, 1877, it was named simply,
    Edmonton.</p>

    called Little Falls (the Petit Sault of the Acadians). The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span> present name was given in honour of Sir Edmund Head
    on the occasion of his visit in 1848. He was Lieutenant-Governor
    of New Brunswick from 1848 to 1854, and
    Governor-General of Canada from 1855 to 1861.</p>
<p>Sir Edmund was a brilliant scholar and an experienced
    poor-law commissioner before his appointment as
    governor. He was appreciated in New Brunswick but
    was accused of partiality to the Conservative Party by a
    portion of the community in Canada. The task of an
    administrator in Canada at this period was a most difficult
    one, owing to the country being in the throes of the
    evolution of responsible government.</p>

    Alberta.</p>
<p>It was named after the Eiffel Tower, Paris, France,
    which it is said to resemble in some respects. This tower
    was constructed by Gustave Eiffel, a celebrated French
    engineer, in 1889. It was one of the attractions of the
    Paris Exposition of that year. The total height of the
    tower is 984 feet and the weight of iron 7,325 tons. Persons
    may be carried to the top by a system of elevators.
    The cost was about $1,000,000.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Ekfrid</span>: township in Middlesex county, Ontario, organized
    in 1821.</p>
<p>It took its name from Ekfrid or Eckfrith who was
    King of Northumbria (Northumberland, England), from
    670 to 685. Ekfrid was an aggressive prince, taking the
    kingdom of Cumbria from the Britons. He met defeat
    and death at the hands of the Picts. Ekfrid&rsquo;s Queen,
    Ethelreda, was of a highly religious disposition. She
    withdrew from court, entered a monastery, and later fled
    to the Isle of Ely, which she held in her own right, and
    where she founded an influential church.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Elderslie</span>: township, Bruce county, Ontario, formed in
    1850.</p>
<p>It took its name from the village of Elderslie in Renfrew
    county, Scotland. It is said to be the birthplace of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span> Sir William Wallace, Scotland&rsquo;s hero in its fight for independence
    against Edward I.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Eldon</span>: township in Victoria county, Ontario, surveyed
    in 1823.</p>
<p>An English statesman, John Scott, 1751-1838, of Newcastle,
    raised to the peerage as Lord Eldon, was honoured
    in its name. He entered Parliament in 1783 and was
    Attorney-General and Lord Chancellor for many years.
    History ranks Eldon as a man of considerable ability but
    a time-server withal.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Elgin</span>: county in Ontario, constituted in 1851. Formerly
    it was part of the forgotten Suffolk county, formed
    in 1792, and then for a period part of Middlesex county.</p>
<p>The name was given in honour of Lord Elgin, Governor-General
    of Canada, 1847-&rsquo;54. The title was taken
    from the city of Elgin in Elgin county, Scotland.</p>
<p>Elgin took up the reins of administration at a period
    of great commercial depression and political unrest.
    Through perseverance, tact and good judgment he mastered
    the situation. He stood firmly by responsible government.
    Perhaps his greatest achievement was the
    Treaty of Reciprocity with the United States, 1854.</p>
<p>Elgin is also the name of a canton in Huntington
    county, Quebec, erected in 1849, and of a pleasant village
    in Leeds county, Ontario, founded about 1855. Both were
    named to commemorate the Governor. The village name
    was suggested by Robert Dargavel, a Scotch pioneer of
    the district.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Elizabethtown</span>: township in the county of Leeds, Ontario,
    formed in 1784.</p>
<p>It took its name from Princess Elizabeth, 1770-1840,
    third daughter of King George III. The Princess is said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span> to have been quiet in her manners, affectionate to her
    friends, and strictly correct in her private life.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Ellice</span>: township in Perth county, Ontario, erected in
    1830.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of the Right Hon. Edward
    Ellice, 1781-1863. Mr. Ellice was one of the first directors
    of the Canada Land Company, also intimately connected
    with the North West Company. He was member
    of the British Parliament for many years, and efficient
    and popular as Secretary of the Treasury.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Elma</span>: township in Perth county, Ontario, organized
    in 1849.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Lady Elma Bruce, daughter
    of the Earl of Elgin, Governor-General of Canada, 1847-&rsquo;54.
    The name Elma is said to mean &ldquo;a beam of light.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="bold">Elmira</span>: picturesque village in Wellington county,
    Ontario.</p>
<p>The first settlers here were probably U.E. Loyalists
    who brought the name from Elmira, New York State.
    The word means &ldquo;the beautiful, the wonderful&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Elmsley</span>: South Elmsley township in Leeds county and
    North Elmsley in Lanark county, Ontario, were both
    formed in 1798.</p>
<p>They took their name from William Elmsley, Chief-Justice
    of Canada at this period. Lord Durham, in his
    report, stated that Elmsley had acquired the title to much
    land at from a gallon of rum to £6 per 200 acres. At the
    time of his death in 1805 he possessed residences in Quebec,
    York, and Newark. The Elmsley property in Toronto
    became very valuable. The family name is preserved
    in a street name, Elmsley Place. When Lord Elgin moved
    to Toronto after the destruction of the Parliament Buildings
    in Montreal, he resided at Elmsley Villa.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Eloida</span>: village and lake in Leeds county, Ontario.</p>
<p>Several U.E. Loyalists by the name of Parish moved
    to this section of Upper Canada after the Revolutionary
    War. Eliada Parish settled near the lake which took its
    name from him. The writer is indebted to the research
    of Mr. S. C. A. Lamb, Phm.B., of Athens for this information.</p>
<p>Eloida seems to be a corruption of the Biblical name
    Elidad, Numbers xxxiv, 21, or Eliada, Samuel v, 16, meaning
    &ldquo;whom God loves or cares for&rdquo;. Since the foregoing
    paragraphs were written the Geographic Board of Canada
    has decided to confer the name Loyada upon this lake.
    This is the form of the name on the 1861 map of Leeds
    county. Why a corrupted form instead of the original?</p>
<p><span class="bold">Elora</span>: prosperous town on the picturesque Grand in
    Wellington county, Ontario.</p>
<p>It was so named by William Gilkison who settled here
    in 1832, having purchased 14,000 acres at the Grand
    River Falls. Elora is derived from Elura, an Hindustan
    word for the entrance to the Indian temple of Paradise.
    Gilkison was entertaining some friends in a river-cave
    near by when an inspiration of the moment suggested the
    name.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Elzevir</span>: township in Hastings county, Ontario, surveyed
    in 1820.</p>
<p>It took its name from a Dutch family who established
    a book-printing business in Leyden, the oldest city in
    Holland, in 1580. Their published works were distinguished
    for their beautiful typography. A genuine
    &ldquo;Elzevir&rdquo; became a treasure. The word Elzevir is said to
    denote &ldquo;elm wood&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Emerson</span>: town in southern Manitoba, founded by the
    Fairbanks family.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

    of Lord George Lennox. She was a sister of the Duke of
    Richmond, Governor-General of Canada, 1818-&rsquo;19, whose
    untimely death was due to hydrophobia caused by the
    bite of a tame fox.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Enderby</span>: city in Yale district, British Columbia.</p>
<p>It took its name from the village of Enderby in Lincolnshire,
    England. In the Doomsday Book it is written
    Enderbie. The word means &ldquo;the dwelling or village of
    Endred&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Englehart</span>: town on the Temiscaming and Northern
    Ontario Railway, in the district of Temiscaming, Ontario.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Jacob Lewis Englehart for
    some time in the Ontario public service. He was one of
    the pioneers in the petroleum trade in the districts of
    London and Petrolea, Ontario. In 1905 Mr. Englehart
    was made chairman of the Temiscaming and Northern
    Ontario Railway Board. He is a man of great wealth,
    public spirit, and high ability.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Enniskillen</span>: township in Lambton county, Ontario,
    formed in 1834.</p>
<p>It took its name from the town of Enniskillen in Fermanagh
    county, Ulster, Ireland. The name was suggested,
    doubtless, by Sir John Colborne, Lieut.-Governor of
    Upper Canada 1829-&rsquo;36. A son of the first Earl of Enniskillen,
    General Sir Galbraith Lowry Cole, was a comrade-in-arms
    of Sir John in the Peninsular War. The word
    is said to be a corruption of the Gaelic <i>Inis-Cethlenn</i>,
    meaning &ldquo;Cethlenn&rsquo;s island&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Ennismore</span>: township in Peterborough county, Ontario,

<p>It was named in honour of William Hare, Viscount
    Ennismore. His father Richard of Ennismore was M.P.

    county of Kerry, Free State, Ireland.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Eramosa</span>: township in Wellington county, Ontario,
    surveyed in 1822.</p>
<p>The name is said to be Indian in origin, meaning &ldquo;a
    dog&rdquo;, or by some &ldquo;a dead dog&rdquo;. The story runs that the
    surveyors stumbled upon a dead dog on entering this district,
    hence the name Eramosa.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Erie</span>: one of the Great Lakes of Ontario. Fort Erie
    is the name of a village and also of a Provincial Park of
    seventeen acres embracing the ruins of old Fort Erie, in
    Welland county, Ontario. The Park is part of the Queen
    Victoria, Niagara Falls, Provincial Park System of 1,664
    acres of land and water surface stretching along the
    thirty-five miles of river between Lake Erie and Lake
    Ontario.</p>
<p>The word Erie is Iroquois in origin and means &ldquo;cat&rdquo;.
    It was applied by them to the Indian tribe living in the
    vicinity of Lake Erie, called by some writers the Cat
    Nation. Charlevoix says the name was given on account
    of the great number of cats frequenting this district in
    former days. Albert Cusick, an Indian scholar of the
    United States, says the Eries are usually identified with
    the Kah-kwah nation and that Kah-kwah means &ldquo;an eye
    swelled like a cat&rsquo;s&rdquo;, that is, prominent rather than deep,
    a characteristic of this tribe.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Erin</span>: thriving village and township in Wellington
    county, Ontario, erected in 1820.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>
<p>Erin is one of the ancient names of Ireland, generally
    used in modern times in poetry only. The oldest form of
    Ireland&rsquo;s native name is Erin, genitive Érenn, dative
    rinn. The word is said to be a corruption of Sanscrit,
    Avara meaning &ldquo;western&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In modern Gaelic Erin was written Eire (two syllables).
    This gave rise to Eireland or Ireland (land of
    Eire or the West).</p>
<p><span class="bold">Ermatinger</span>: mount, 10,180 feet, Rocky Mountains,
    Alberta and Kootenay district, B.C.</p>

<p>It was named in honour of Prince Ernest Augustus,
    fifth son of King George III., 1771-1851. He became Grand
    Master of the Orange Lodges of Great Britain in 1828,
    opposed the Catholic Emancipation Bill of 1829, and was
    connected with a conspiracy to exclude Princess Victoria
    from the throne and elevate him in her stead. In 1837
    the Prince became King of Hanover and Britain knew him

    See <i>Yonge</i>.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Espanola</span>: town, Sudbury district, Ontario.</p>
<p>Espagnola, of which Hispaniola is the Latinized form,
    was the name given by Columbus to the island of Haiti
    on its discovery by him in 1492. The English of Espagnola
    is &ldquo;little Spain&rdquo;, and Espanola is derived from it by
    the omission of the letter &ldquo;g&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The classic form of the name is of late date. The town
    was originally called Spanish (so-called on some maps
    still) after the Spanish River which runs through it into
    the North Channel, Lake Huron. It is said the river was
    so named from the adjoining district having once been
    occupied by Spanish Indians, presumably from Spanish
    America.</p>

    &ldquo;shame on you&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Essex</span>: county in Ontario, surveyed in 1792.</p>
<p>It took its name from Essex county in England. The
    word is derived from the Kingdom of the East Saxons,

<p><span class="bold">Estevan</span>: enterprising town on the C.P.R., Saskatchewan.</p>
<p>The place was named in honour of George Stephen
    and William C. Van Horne, the former a director, the
    latter general manager of the company that built the
    Canadian Pacific Railway. The word was formed by the
    selection of letters from the name of each, thus Georg[e
    Ste]phen, W. C. [Van] Horne.</p>
<p>Both were deeply appreciated by the Crown for the
    splendid services they rendered Canada and the Empire.
    Mr. Stephen became Lord Mount Stephen and Mr. Van

<p><span class="bold">Foch</span> (pronounced Foash): mount, 10,130 feet, lat.
    50° 34&#8242;, long. 115° 09&#8242;, Alberta and B.C.</p>
<p>It was named after Marshal Ferdinand Foch, famous
    French General in the Great War, 1914-&rsquo;18, and Generalissimo
    of the allied forces, 1918-&rsquo;19. He died at the age
    of seventy-seven years in March, 1929, and was buried
    near the tomb of Napoleon I. in the Invalides, Paris.</p>
<p>The most classic despatch (reputed) of the Great War
    has been credited to him while engaged at the first battle
    of the Marne. It was said General Foch reported to his
    superior officer, Marshal Joffre, in these words: &ldquo;My
    right is crushed. My left is in retreat. I am attacking
    with my centre.&rdquo; The story has had several variations,
    the most important of which is: &ldquo;Pressed on my right
    wing, with my centre broken, I am attacking with my
    left. My situation is excellent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>General Foch (Marshal in 1918) held that offence
    was the best method of defence and an utterance of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span> foregoing nature would accord well with his theory but
    the <i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i> states that the story is a
    legend and President Poincaré made a similar remark
    when welcoming the immortal Marshal to the French
    Academy in 1920. The story persisted in finding credence,
    however, and gained popular prestige for Foch at an
    opportune time.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Foley</span>: township, Parry Sound district, Ontario,
    erected in 1866.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Hon. Michael Hamilton
    Foley, M.P. for Waterloo at this period. He was Post-Master
    General for a term previous to Confederation,
    1867. Mr. Foley was born in Sligo, Ireland, in 1820, and
    was a journalist in Simcoe and Brantford before entering
    Parliament.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Fort Frances</span>: town, Rainy River district, Ontario,
    incorporated in 1903.</p>
<p>In 1731 Pierre de la Vérendrye and his followers
    erected Fort St. Pierre here, but made no permanent
    settlement.</p>
<p>In 1793 representatives of both the North West Trading
    Company and the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company arrived
    and erected trading posts. The Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company
    named its establishment Fort Frances in honour of Lady
    Frances Ramsay Simpson (died 1853), wife of Sir George
    Simpson, Governor of the Company. When the two companies
    amalgamated in 1825 Fort Frances was retained.
    It burned down in 1902 and the Company withdrew, leaving
    only the historic name to the town.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Fort William</span>: city on Lake Superior, Thunder Bay
    district, Ontario. It and Port Arthur are called &ldquo;the twin
    cities&rdquo;, because of their resemblance in origin, growth and
    location.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>
<p>It was named in honour of William McGillivray of the
    North West Company who directed the construction of a
    fort here in 1801-&rsquo;03 to facilitate the Company&rsquo;s fur trade.
    Mr. McGillivray was a member of both the Assembly and
    Council of Lower Canada for some years. He died in
    Scotland in 1825.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Fox</span> or <span class="bold">Foxe</span>: channel and land, Baffin Island, Franklin
    district, N.W.T.</p>
<p>They were named in honour of Luke Fox, an English
    navigator, who explored part of Baffin Island and discovered
    Cumberland peninsula, known formerly as Cumberland
    island, in 1631. He related his experiences in a
    book entitled <i>Northwest Fox</i>.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Franklin</span>: the most northerly district of Canada, and
    also a township in Muskoka district, Ontario, formed in
    1865.</p>
<p>They are both named in honour of Admiral Sir John
    Franklin, the Arctic explorer. He was born in Lincolnshire,
    England, in 1786, served with distinction in the
    navy at Copenhagen in 1801 and at Trafalgar in 1805,
    was Governor of Tasmania, 1836-&rsquo;43, and perished in the
    far North in 1847, with his 134 officers and men, in an
    effort to discover the North-west Passage.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Fraser</span>: the largest river in British Columbia.</p>
<p>It was named about 1808 by the officers of the North
    West Company in honour of Simon Fraser, 1776-1862,
    the Company&rsquo;s superintendent of the then district of New
    Caledonia. Mr. Fraser was the first white man to explore
    this river from its source to its mouth.</p>
<p>Fraser is also the name of a township in Renfrew
    county, Ontario, organized in 1854. It is uncertain in
    whose honour it was named; many members of the Fraser
    family have been prominent in Canadian history.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Fredericksburg</span>: township, North and South, Lennox
    county, Ontario, surveyed in 1784.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Prince Frederick, second
    son of King George III., 1763-1827. He was hereditary
    Bishop of Osnabruck in Germany but adopted a military
    career. The Prince saw active service against Holland
    and in 1795 was made a Field-Marshal and Commander-in-Chief
    of the British army.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Fredericton</span>: the capital city of the province of New
    Brunswick.</p>
<p>It was named by Governor Carleton. The word occurs
    first in an Order-in-Council of February 22, 1785, &ldquo;a town
    at St. Anne&rsquo;s Point, on River St. John, to be called
    Frederick Town after His Royal Highness, Prince Frederick,
    Bishop of Osnabruck&rdquo;. He was the second son of
    King George III.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Freeman</span>: township in Muskoka district, Ontario,
    formed in 1881.</p>
<p>It was named after John Bailey Freeman, M.P.P. at
    this period for North Norfolk, Ontario. Mr. Freeman&rsquo;s
    family was of U.E. Loyalist descent and among the first
    settlers of the Long Point district. He was elected to the
    Legislature as a Liberal in 1879 and was chosen Government
    whip in 1883.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Freswick</span>: township, Nipissing district, Ontario,
    organized in 1885.</p>
<p>It was named after the village of Freswick in the
    parish of Canisbay, Caithness, Scotland. The old home of
    the Mowat family was in the parish of Canisbay and the
    name of this township was suggested by Sir Oliver
    Mowat, Premier of Ontario, 1872-1896.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Frontenac</span>: county in Ontario and also one in Quebec.</p>
<p>Both were named in honour of Louis de Buade, Count
    de Frontenac, 1620-&rsquo;98, Governor of New France for
    twenty years. The word is a corruption of Frontignac,
    a sweet grape wine made in Frontignac in the Department
    of Herault, France.</p>
<p>Frontenac consecrated all his energies to the development
    of Canada. He was brave and sagacious, but quick-tempered,
    haughty, and cruel. It is said that Frontenac
    found the high temper of his wife unbearable and that he
    was given the government of Canada in 1672 to deliver
    him from home harangues.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Fryatt</span>: mount, 11,026 feet, Rocky Mountains, Alberta.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Captain Fryatt, an English
    sailor, shot by the Germans in Bruges, Belgium, on July
    27, 1916, on a charge of having defended his ship against
    a submarine.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Fuca</span>: strait between Vancouver Island, B.C., and the
    state of Washington, U.S.</p>
<p>It took its name from Juan de Fuca, a Portuguese
    navigator, by whom it was discovered. The name was
    retained by Captain Vancouver when he took formal
    possession for Britain in 1792.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Fullarton</span>: township, Perth county, Ontario, formed in
    1830.</p>
<p>It was named after John Fullarton, one of the Directors
    of the Canada Land Company, a company of British
    capitalists, organized by John Galt, to settle and withal to
    exploit choice wild lands in Upper Canada.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Fundy</span>: bay, an arm of the Atlantic Ocean, almost
    separating Nova Scotia from New Brunswick.</p>
<p>The origin of the name is somewhat uncertain. Many
    writers derive it from French <i>Fond de la Baie</i>, corrupted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span> into Fundy Bay, meaning &ldquo;head of the bay&rdquo;, as if applied
    in the first instance to the entrance of the bay. However
    this French phrase might be translated &ldquo;deep bay&rdquo;. On
    Portuguese maps of the 16th century it is marked Rio
    Fondo, meaning &ldquo;deep river&rdquo;, that is, a water extending
    far inland. Cabot&rsquo;s map of 1544 also has Rio Fondo. The
    weight of evidence is in favour of this origin.</p>

<h2><a name="G" id="G">G</a></h2>
<p><span class="bold">Gabarus</span>: bay, cape, lake, village in Cape Breton
    county, Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>It is generally believed to have been named after a
    French officer of Bayonne. It is also said to be a corruption
    of French <i>Cap Rouge</i>, &ldquo;Red Cape&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Gainsborough</span>: township in Lincoln county, Ontario,
    surveyed in 1798.</p>
<p>It took its name from Gainsborough town in Lincolnshire,
    England. It was here that Sweyn, the Danish King,
    was assassinated after his ruthless march through eastern
    England.</p>
<p>Gainsborough is also the name of a tributary of the
    Souris River in Saskatchewan and Manitoba. It was
    named in honour of an early settler, J. J. Sadler, whose
    home town was Gainsborough, Lincolnshire.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Galt</span>: city in Waterloo county, Ontario.</p>
<p>It took its name from John Galt, the Scottish novelist,
    1779-1839. The city was founded in 1816 by William
    Dickson, a school-fellow in Edinburgh of Galt, who had
    purchased the whole township of Dumfries. John Galt
    was Commissioner of the Canada Land Company and
    resided in Canada from 1826 to 1829. He visited the place
    in 1827 and was entertained by his friend Dickson.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Galway</span>: township, Peterborough county, Ontario,
    organized in 1857.</p>
<p>It took its name from the county of Galway, Irish
    Free State, the county town of which is the city of
    Galway.</p>
<p>The origin of the word is disputed. Some think it may
    come from Spanish <i>gala</i> meaning &ldquo;ornament&rdquo;. In early
    times this port had an extensive trade with Spain. Other
    writers connect it with the historic Gauls.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Gananoque</span>: town on the St. Lawrence River, at the
    mouth of the Gananoque River in Leeds county, Ontario.
    It was founded in 1798 by Colonel Joel Stone who erected
    a saw mill and carried on a small mercantile business.</p>
<p>The name is Indian, and is generally said to signify
    &ldquo;rocks rising out of the water&rdquo;. Some writers on Indian
    names state it means &ldquo;meadows rising out of the water&rdquo;,
    and others that it means &ldquo;wild potatoes&rdquo;, that is &ldquo;ground
    nuts&rdquo;. However, in the river Gananoque is what is called
    &ldquo;marble rock&rdquo;. It rises above the surface of the water in
    many places in the middle of the river.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Garafraxa</span>: East, Dufferin county, Ontario, and Garafraxa,
    West, Wellington county, were formed in 1821.</p>
<p>The origin of the name is uncertain. Some consider it
    a corruption of sassafras, a shrub or tree that was plentiful
    when the township was being surveyed. Other writers
    state the word is Indian meaning &ldquo;the panther country&rdquo;,
    and was applied by the Indians to the whole district
    between the Saugeen Trail and the Toronto Trail.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Gaspé</span>: county in Quebec. The origin of the word is
    disputed. Most writers state it is Micmac Indian, meaning
    &ldquo;the end or extremity&rdquo;, referring to the northern
    limits of Micmac country. Others derive it from Gaspar
    Cortereal, the Portuguese navigator, who visited this
    coast about the year 1500. Other writers connect Gaspé
    with Caspe, a community in Aragon, Spain, from which
    Basque fishermen came to these shores in the fifteenth
    century.</p>
<p>Gaspé is also the name of a peninsula, bay, and village
    in Gaspé county.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Gaspereau</span>: lake and river in King&rsquo;s county, Nova
    Scotia.</p>
<p>It is derived from the French word <i>gasparot</i>, the name
    the Acadians gave to a fish found in abundance in these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span> waters. This fish is known to the English as the alewife.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Gatineau</span>: river, an affluent of the river Ottawa, and
    also a lake in the Province of Quebec.</p>
<p>Both are named after the Gatineau family who settled
    in the neighbourhood of these waters. Nicolas Gatineau,
    connected with the Company of One Hundred Associates,
    arrived in 1649. He was a notary and also a famous
    fur-trader.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Georgetown</span>, <span class="bold">Georgia</span>, <span class="bold">Georgian</span> and <span class="bold">Georgina</span>. Georgetown
    is a thriving town in Halton county, Ontario.</p>
<p>Georgia is a strait between Vancouver Island and the
    mainland of B.C.</p>
<p>Georgian is a bay, the eastern arm of Lake Huron,
    Ontario.</p>
<p>Georgina is a township in York county, Ontario, organized
    in 1815.</p>
<p>These names represent the laboured efforts of authorities
    to honour King George III. in the nomenclature of
    Canada.</p>
<p>In 1929 the Federal Government, through the Department
    of the Interior, set aside twenty-eight islands in
    Georgian Bay for a new National Park. Beausoleil is the
    largest and most interesting. It comprises 2,712 acres.
    Its name signifies &ldquo;beautiful and sunny&rdquo;. It possesses
    great scenic beauty and historic interest. This island is
    connected with the triple battle of St. Louis, March, 1649,
    on the Ridge just above the site of Port McNichol. After
    their defeat by the Iroquois, refugees from the other
    Indian tribes came to Beausoleil and settled there and the
    ruins of some of their buildings may still be seen.</p>
<p>These islands were acquired from the Indians by the
    Crown in 1856. The new National Park is reached by
    boat from either Midland or Penetang, Ontario.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Gibson</span>: township in Muskoka district, Ontario, formed
    in 1880. It was so designated in honour of Thomas
    Gibson, M.P.P., who represented one of the ridings of
    Huron county in the Legislature of Ontario from 1867 to
    1898. Mr. Gibson was a man of good judgment and his
    advice was sought in the Assembly.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Glace Bay</span>: town in Cape Breton county, Cape Breton,
    N.S. It is one of the greatest coal-mining centres in the
    world. Here is a Marconi receiving station for wireless
    telegraphy across the Atlantic.</p>
<p>The town&rsquo;s name is taken from the French word glace
    meaning ice. The bay is long ice-bound each year. It
    was so when the French explorers first saw it.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Glamorgan</span>: township in Haliburton district, Ontario,
    erected in 1862.</p>
<p>It took its name from the county of Glamorgan in
    South Wales, Great Britain. The word is a contraction
    of the Welsh Gwlad Morgan, meaning &ldquo;the county of
    Morgan&rdquo;. The word Morgan is derived from Mor which
    signifies the sea. Glamorgan is said to have been the
    name of a Welsh Prince who lived about 800 B.C.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Glanford</span>: township, Lincoln county, Ontario, organized
    in 1798.</p>
<p>It was named after Glanford Bridge, a village in Lincolnshire,
    England.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Glenelg</span>: township, Grey county, Ontario, formed in
    1840.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Charles Grant, Lord
    Glenelg. The title was taken from Glenelg, county of
    Inverness, Scotland. Lord Glenelg was Secretary of State
    for War and the Colonies in the British Government during
    the Canadian Rebellion of 1837-&rsquo;38. Glenelg favoured
    an elective Legislative Council for Canada. King William<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span> IV. opposed the elective principle for the constitution of
    the legislative councils of the colonies. Glenelg found his
    administration unpopular and retired from the Government
    in 1839.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Glengarry</span>: county in Ontario, surveyed in 1792.</p>
<p>It took its name from the famous glen in Inverness,
    Scotland, beside the little river Gary. The first settlers
    in this country were Scottish Highlanders. Some were
    U.E. Loyalists who made their way to the northern
    banks of the St. Lawrence when the United States became
    independent, others came directly from Scotland at a
    somewhat later date when trade became dull at home.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Gloucester</span>: township in Carleton county, Ontario,
    formed in 1798.</p>
<p>It took its name from William Frederick, Duke of
    Gloucester, 1776-1834, a nephew of King George III. The
    title was taken from Gloucestershire, England.</p>
<p>In the Cathedral of the city of Gloucester is a statue to
    Robert Raikes, the founder of national Sunday Schools.
    The house still stands in St. Catharine St., Gloucester, in
    which the first school was opened in July, 1780.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Goderich</span>: township in Huron county, Ontario, erected
    in 1828, and also the county town of Huron. The town
    was founded in 1827 by John Galt, Commissioner of the
    Canada Company.</p>
<p>Both were named in honour of the Right Hon. John
    Robinson, Viscount Goderich, Earl of Ripon, 1782-1859.
    He entered Parliament in 1806 and had a distinguished
    political career. He was Secretary for the Colonies for
    several years before the Rebellion period of 1837-&rsquo;38.
    Goderich evinced a genuine desire to remove all grievances
    of the Canadian people but his concessions and
    reforms were often ill-received by the Assembly.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>
<p>This statesman became Premier of the Empire in
    1833.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Gordon</span>: township in Manitoulin district, Ontario, surveyed
    in 1871, by Mr. Edgar Bray.</p>
<p>The origin of the name is uncertain but the honour is
    generally given to the Hon. James Gordon, a resident of
    Toronto, and member of the Legislative Council of Canada
    for twenty years, 1845-&rsquo;65.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Gosfield</span>: township in Essex county, Ontario. It was
    erected in 1792.</p>
<p>The name was taken from the village of Gosfield in
    Essex county, England. Here stands the inviting Gosfield
    Hall, the home of the Dukes of Buckingham.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Gouin</span>: canton, county of Jolliette, Quebec, erected in
    1903.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Sir Lomer Gouin, for many
    years Premier of the province of Quebec. In 1928 he was
    appointed Lieutenant-Governor of the province of Quebec.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Gower</span>: South Gower township, Grenville county, and
    North Gower township, Carleton county, Ontario, were
    surveyed in 1798.</p>
<p>They took their name from Admiral the Hon. John
    Leveson Gower (1740-1792), a distinguished naval officer.
    He was Lord of the British Admiralty, 1783-&rsquo;89.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Granby</span>: township in Shefford county, Quebec, surveyed
    in 1792, and a city in the same locality founded in
    1858.</p>
<p>There are several Granbys in England. This is the
    name of a parish and a village in Bedfordshire, from
    which probably Quebec Granby took its name. The origin
    of the name is, doubtless, grand and the Danish <i>by</i>, a
    village or town.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Grand Manan</span>: island, Charlotte county, N.B.</p>
<p>The word is derived from Passamaquoddy or Micmac
    Indian, <i>mun-aa-nook</i>, &ldquo;the island&rdquo;, with French <i>grand</i> to
    distinguish it from Petit Manan on the Maine coast. It
    was erected into a parish in 1816.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Grand Pré</span>: district on the shores of Minas Basin,
    Kings county, Nova Scotia. It is also the name of a small
    village and a railway station in the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>Grand Pré means in English &ldquo;great meadow&rdquo;. At
    one time it was an Acadian settlement of rare beauty and
    fertility. When the province fell into the hands of the
    British, many of the Acadians refused to take the oath of
    allegiance. For several years the Provincial Government
    tried by peaceful methods to gain their adherence to
    British rule, but in vain. The long patience of the authorities
    was finally exhausted and what is known as the
    Expulsion of the Acadians took place in 1753&mdash;an act of
    absolute necessity for the protection of British settlements.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Grantham</span>: township, Lincoln county, Ontario, was
    formed in 1792.</p>
<p>It took its name from the town of Grantham, Lincolnshire,
    England. It was at Grantham that Cromwell won
    his first victory over King Charles I.&rsquo;s forces.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Grattan</span>: township in Renfrew county, Ontario. It
    was surveyed in 1851.</p>
<p>The area was named in honour of Henry Grattan
    (1750-1820). Mr. Grattan was elected to the Irish Parliament
    in 1775. He was of the opinion that the British
    Parliament had no right to legislate for Ireland and
    opposed the union of the Irish Parliament with the English
    Parliament in 1800, forming the Imperial Parliament.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Gravenhurst</span>: thriving town at the foot of Lake Muskoka,
    Ontario. It is the gateway to one of Canada&rsquo;s most
    picturesque and salubrious summer play-grounds.</p>
<p>The town&rsquo;s early name was McCabe&rsquo;s Landing. A. P.
    Cockburn, at one time President of the Muskoka and
    Nipissing Navigation Co., and a discoverer of the scenic
    beauty of this northern group of lakes, secured for the
    people of the district improved postal facilities. The new
    name of Gravenhurst came from the Postmaster-General&rsquo;s
    office. The only place the name seems to occur is in
    Washington Irving&rsquo;s story entitled &ldquo;Bracebridge Hall&rdquo;,
    in which it is referred to as a location in England. As it
    is not found in England in any of the Gazeteers of the
    world, it likely existed only in Irving&rsquo;s imagination.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Greenock</span>: village and township, Bruce county,
    Ontario, formed in 1850.</p>
<p>It took its name from Greenock, on the estuary of the
    Clyde River, Renfrew county, Scotland. Greenock is the
    seaport of Glasgow and has a large world commerce. It
    is also a ship-building centre. One of the titles of Lord
    Cathcart, Commander of the forces in British America in
    1845, and Governor of Canada from Lord Metcalfe&rsquo;s
    departure until the arrival of Lord Elgin in 1847, was
    Baron Greenock.</p>
<p>The name Greenock is derived from the Gaelic <i>grian</i>,
    genitive <i>gréine</i> meaning &ldquo;of the sun&rdquo; plus <i>cnoc</i> meaning
    &ldquo;a hill&rdquo;, that is &ldquo;a sunny hill&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Greenwood</span>: city in British Columbia, incorporated in
    1897.</p>
<p>Robert Wood was the first settler in 1895 and he
    owned the town site which was covered with green timber.
    These facts suggested the name, Greenwood.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Grenville</span>: county in Ontario, erected in 1792.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of William Wyndham Grenville,
    1750-1834. He was elected to the British House of
    Commons in 1782 and chosen Speaker in 1789. Mr. Grenville
    was created Baron Grenville in 1790 and was Secretary
    of State for Foreign Affairs for ten years, 1791 to
    1801. He voted for the Canada Bill or Constitutional Act
    of 1791. His father, George Grenville, was the reputed
    author of the Stamp Act of 1765 which brought about the
    revolt of the American Colonies in 1775.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Grey</span>: county, Ontario, erected in 1852, and Grey
    township, Huron county, in 1848.</p>
<p>Both were named after Charles, second Earl Grey,
    1764-1845. The Grey family, of Saxon origin, rose to
    eminence in James I.&rsquo;s reign. Earl Grey entered Parliament
    in 1786. For eighteen years he led the opposition,
    and on the defeat of the Wellington Government in 1830,
    became Prime Minister with &ldquo;peace, retrenchment, and
    Parliamentary reform&rdquo; as his policy.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Griffith</span>: township in Renfrew county, Ontario, formed
    in 1859.</p>
<p>The origin of the name is quite uncertain. Several
    officers of the name distinguished themselves in the naval
    and military service of the British Empire. Some think
    the township was named in honour of Colonel Griffith who
    commanded the Greys at Balaclava, 1854.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Grimsby</span>: township, North, and South Lincoln county,
    Ontario, were surveyed in 1792. Grimsby is also the name
    of a charming town in this county.</p>
<p>The name is taken from Great Grimsby, Lincolnshire,
    England. There is a tradition about the name. It is said
    that a local fisherman named Grime found a Danish
    Prince named Havelock in a boat adrift and took care of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span> the lad who, grown to maturity, married the daughter of
    the King of England. In confirmation the story runs that
    Danish conquerors granted special favours to Grime&rsquo;s
    by or town, that is Grimsby. The surname Grim is very
    common in England.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Grimsthorpe</span>: township in Hastings county, Ontario,
    surveyed in 1822.</p>
<p>It took its name from Grimsthorpe Castle in Lincoln
    county, England. This Castle was built by Charles Brandon,
    Duke of Suffolk, to entertain his royal brother-in-law,
    King Henry VIII. Sir Peregrine Maitland, Lieutenant-Governor
    of Upper Canada at this period, suggested the
    name. His relative, Sir Peregrine Bertie, was owner of
    Grimsthorpe Castle at this time.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Grosse Ile</span>: island in the St. Lawrence River, Montmagny
    county, Quebec.</p>
<p>The name is French, meaning &ldquo;great island&rdquo;, given to
    distinguish it from others in the vicinity. A quarantine
    station is maintained on Grosse Ile.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Guelph</span>: city and township in Wellington county,
    Ontario, both of which were founded in 1827.</p>
<p>Mr. John Galt of the Canada Company chose this
    name in compliment to the Royal Family whose baptismal
    name was Guelph.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Guilford</span>: township in Haliburton district, Ontario,
    erected in 1861.</p>
<p>It took its name from the town of Guilford (Guildford)
    on the river Wey in Surrey county, England. This
    town possesses a written charter issued to its citizens in
    1256.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Gurd</span>: township, Parry Sound district, Ontario, surveyed
    in 1875.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>
<p>It was named by Hon. T. B. Pardee, Commissioner of
    Crown Lands at the time in honour of his friend and
    political supporter, R. S. Gurd. The Gurd family were,
    and still are, prominent citizens of Sarnia, Lambton
    county. Mr. Gurd was a lawyer by profession.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Guthrie</span>: township in Nipissing district, Ontario. It
    was organized in 1890.</p>
<p>This area was named in honour of Donald Guthrie,
    Q.C., of Guelph. Mr. Guthrie was M.P. for South Wellington,
    1876-&rsquo;82, and elected M.P.P. for the same constituency
    in 1886.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Guysborough</span>: county in Nova Scotia, and also the
    name of a township and a town within the county.</p>
<p>They were named in honour of Sir Guy Carleton,
    second Governor of British Canada. Guysborough township
    was settled by disbanded soldiers who had served
    under General Sir Guy Carleton, the hero of the siege of
    Quebec, 1775.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Gwillimbury</span>: township, East, North and West, York
    county, Ontario, formed in 1798.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Miss Gwillim, a young lady
    of Wales, who became the wife of Lieut.-Governor John
    Graves Simcoe. Miss Gwillim&rsquo;s father was a soldier, aide-de-camp
    to General Wolfe, and was killed before Quebec
    in 1759. The Duc de la Rochefoucalt, writing in 1795,
    said, &ldquo;Mrs. Simcoe is a woman of sense, handsome and
    amiable, and fulfils all the duties of a mother and a wife
    with the most scrupulous exactness.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="bold">Hagarty</span>: township in Renfrew county, Ontario,
    formed in 1862.</p>
<p>It was named after the Hon. John H. Hagarty who
    was born in Ireland in 1816 and educated at Trinity
    College, Dublin. He was appointed Chief-Justice of
    Ontario in 1868.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Hagerman</span>: township in Parry Sound district, Ontario,
    erected in 1869.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Judge Christopher Alexander
    Hagerman. He served in the war of 1812 and was
    appointed to a puisne judgeship in 1828. At a later date
    Mr. Hagerman became Solicitor-General and prosecuted
    the rebels who were imprisoned in 1838. In this capacity
    he incurred the enmity of their relatives who thought him
    cruelly severe.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Hagersville</span>: incorporated village in Haldimand
    county, Ontario.</p>
<p>The village is named after Charles and David Hager,
    pioneers here, who arrived in 1845. They were of U.E.
    Loyalist descent.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Haig</span>: mount, 11,174 feet, in the Rockies, Alberta and
    B.C., canton in the counties of Pontiac and Montcalm,
    Quebec.</p>
<p>They were named in honour of Field-Marshal Sir
    Douglas Haig, Commander-in-Chief of the British forces
    on the western front in the Great War, 1914-&rsquo;18.</p>
<p>Haig&rsquo;s historic order of 1918: &ldquo;With our backs to the
    wall and believing in the justice of our cause, each one of
    us must fight on to the end&rdquo;, will rank in history with
    Nelson&rsquo;s famous words at Trafalgar, &ldquo;England expects
    every man this day to do his duty&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>
<p>At the end of the war, the British Government presented
    him with the family estate, Bemersyde, free from
    debt ($1,500,000), cash gift of $500,000, and raised him
    to the rank of Earl Haig of Bemersyde.</p>
<p>When he died in 1928, burial in St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral
    was proffered, but he had expressed a wish to be buried in
    the family vault, Dryburgh Abbey. After a memorial
    service in Westminster Abbey, the remains of the great
    soldier were interred at Dryburgh.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Haileybury</span>: town in Timiskaming district, Ontario,
    incorporated in 1904.</p>
<p>The town was founded by Mr. C. C. Farr, who came
    to the site as a settler in the year 1873. At that time
    there was a Hudson Bay Company&rsquo;s post here.</p>
<p>The place was named by Mr. Farr from Haileybury
    College in England, where he was educated.</p>
<p>Haileybury College, two miles south-east of Hertford
    and twenty-six miles north of London, was erected in
    1809 by the East India Co. as a place of training for
    cadets in their service. After the transference in 1858 of
    the powers of the Company to the Crown, an interval
    ensued during which the College was unused, but in 1862
    a new public school was opened in the building, its numbers
    being limited to 500 by the charter. It has numbered
    among its professors and students many illustrious
    names.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Haldimand</span>: county in Ontario, surveyed in 1783, and
    a township in Northumberland county, Ontario, formed in
    1792.</p>
<p>They were named in honour of Sir Frederick Haldimand,
    1721-&rsquo;91, Governor-General of Canada from 1777 to
    1784. Under his administration the citadel of Quebec
    was designed and begun, and the first system of canals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span> in America was constructed to overcome the rapids of the
    St. Lawrence River. Haldimand has been assailed unjustly
    by some writers as harsh and tyrannical. Kingsford
    made a special study of his administration and in
    summing up his services states, &ldquo;That Canada remained
    a British possession in those trying days was greatly
    owing to his just and firm rule, and to his unwearied
    efforts to safeguard the province&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Haliburton</span>: district in Ontario, organized in 1875.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Thomas Chandler Haliburton,
    born in Windsor, Nova Scotia, in 1796, died in
    Isleworth, England, in 1865. Mr. Haliburton studied law
    and was called to the bar in 1820. He was appointed
    Judge of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in 1840.
    Haliburton is also one of Canada&rsquo;s most distinguished
    authors. His greatest work is <i>The Clockmaker, or Sayings
    and Doings of Samuel Slick of Slickville</i>. In 1842 he
    took up his residence in England and in 1859 was elected
    M.P. for Launceston.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Halifax</span>: city, capital of Nova Scotia, was founded in
    1749 under the patronage and financial support of His
    Majesty&rsquo;s Government. 1176 settlers and their families,
    army and navy veterans for the most part, were transported
    free of cost, supplied with provisions for one year,
    and arms and ammunition for defence. In addition they
    were given free lots, building material, implements for
    tilling the soil, and articles for prosecuting the fishery.</p>
<p>The Hon. Edward Cornwallis was appointed Captain-General
    of the expedition and Governor of Nova Scotia.
    He named the new town Halifax in honour of George
    Montague Dunk, second Earl of Halifax, President of the
    Board of Trade at this period.</p>
<p>Some writers state the word Halifax means Holy Hair.
    It is said a virgin was murdered long ago near this place,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span> (Halifax, York county, England) and suspended by her
    hair from a tree.</p>
<p>The Micmac Indian name for Bedford Basin is
    Chebooktook meaning &ldquo;chief harbour&rdquo;, and for the site
    of Halifax, Gwowamicktook, meaning &ldquo;white pine forest&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Hallowell</span>: mount (3980 feet), Jervis inlet, British
    Columbia. It was named after Admiral Sir Benjamin
    Hallowell Carew, commander H.M.S. <i>Swiftsure</i> in the
    Battle of the Nile, 1798, by Captain Richards, H.M.
    survey vessel <i>Plumper</i>, about 1859.</p>
<p>After this famous victory, Nelson received many gifts,
    but the most extraordinary was one from Captain
    Hallowell who sent him, some months after the battle,
    fearing the effect of all the praise, a coffin with a signed
    certificate pasted on the bottom, &ldquo;Every part of this coffin
    is made of wood and iron of<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a><i>L&rsquo;Orient</i> (a gigantic French
    war-ship) most of which was picked up by H.M.S. under
    my command in the Bay of Aboukir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Accompanying the coffin was the following letter:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
    <p class="sign"> <i>Swiftsure</i>, 23 May, 1799.<br />
    </p>
    <p>My Lord:</p>
    <p>Herewith I send you a coffin made of part of <i>L&rsquo;Orient&rsquo;s</i> mainmast that when you have finished your
        glorious career in this world, you may be buried in one of
        your own trophies; but may that period be far distant
        is the sincere wish of your obedient and much obliged
        servant</p>
    <p class="sign">Ben Hallowell.</p>
</div>
<p>Nelson received this extraordinary gift with the utmost
    cordiality and affection and kept it standing upright
    in his cabin for some months, when his servant persuaded
    him to have it stored below.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>
<p>Hallowell was born in Canada in 1760. He was the
    son of Benjamin Hallowell, commissioner of the American
    Board of Customs. At an early age he entered the navy.</p>
<p>By a curious chance, Hallowell succeeded on the death
    of his cousin, Mrs. Anne Paston Gee, in 1828 to the estate
    of the Carews of Beddington and pursuant to her will,
    assumed the name and arms of Carew, to which family
    he was in no way related.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Hallowell</span>: township in Prince Edward county,
    Ontario, formed in 1797.</p>
<p>It took its name from Benjamin Hallowell, a U.E.
    Loyalist, whose estate in Maine was confiscated and he
    himself banished in 1778. The British Government
    granted Mr. Hallowell lands in Nova Scotia and in Upper
    Canada. Some writers state he received a free grant of a
    great part, if not the whole, of the township which bears
    his name.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Halton</span>: county, Ontario, instituted in 1816. At that
    time it included besides its present limits, Wentworth
    (North), Brant (North), Waterloo and Wellington.</p>
<p>It took its name from Major William Halton, who was
    Secretary to Mr. Francis Gore, Lieut.-Governor of Upper
    Canada from 1806 to 1811 and from 1815 to 1817.</p>
<p>The word Halton signifies &ldquo;a town upon a hill&rdquo;. There
    are several villages in England bearing this name.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Hamilton</span>: city in Wentworth county, Ontario.</p>
<p>It took its name from George Hamilton, son of Hon.
    Robert Hamilton of Niagara who bought a farm here
    in 1812 and divided a part of it into building lots the
    next year.</p>
<p>Hamilton is also the name of a township in Northumberland
    county, Ontario, erected in 1792.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>
<p>It was named in honour of Henry Hamilton, Lieutenant-Governor
    of Lower Canada for a few months in 1785.
    Formerly he had been Governor at Detroit, 1777-&rsquo;78. He
    is said to have possessed courage and energy, but lacked
    the tact and judgment essential for the satisfactory
    performance of the duties of his exalted position.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Hamiota</span>: post village and municipality in Marquette
    county, Manitoba.</p>
<p>The name is contracted from Hamilton, (which see)
    and Sioux Indian <i>otah</i> meaning &ldquo;much, too many&rdquo;, that
    is &ldquo;too many Hamiltons&rdquo;. The original name of the place
    was Hamilton from a large family of settlers of that
    name. On account of mail going to Hamilton, Ontario, in
    mistake, the name was changed to Hamiota.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Hants</span>: county in Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>It is the abbreviated form of Hampshire&mdash;old English
    &ldquo;Hantes shire&rdquo;. It was probably suggested by the U.E.
    Loyalist settlers from New Hampshire, U.S.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Harburn</span>: township, Haliburton district, Ontario,
    formed in 1862.</p>

    Edinburgh county, Scotland.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Harcourt</span>: township in Haliburton district, Ontario,
    organized in 1860.</p>
<p>It was probably named after the village of Harcourt
    in Shropshire, England. Michael Harcourt represented
    Haldimand in the Canadian Assembly before Confederation,
    and his son Hon. Richard Harcourt represented
    Monck in the Ontario Legislature. He became Provincial
    Treasurer in 1890 and at a later date was chosen Minister
    of Education. The district may have been named in
    honour of Mr. Michael Harcourt, M.P.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Hardisty</span>: town and mount, Alberta.</p>

    by the Reformers of South Brant. Mr. Hardy was
    chosen Provincial Secretary in 1877, Commissioner of
    Crown Lands in 1889, and Premier in 1898, a position
    which he held until 1899. He died in 1901.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Harrison</span>: township in Parry Sound district, Ontario,
    surveyed in 1876.</p>
<p>It was named after Hon. Robert Alexander Harrison,
    1833-&rsquo;78. Mr. Harrison studied law and was called to the
    bar in 1855. He achieved great success in his practice in
    Toronto. In 1875 he was appointed Chief-Justice of
    Ontario, the duties of which position he ably discharged
    until his death.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Harvey</span>: township in Peterborough county, Ontario,
    formed in 1821.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Sir John Harvey, 1778-1846,
    a British soldier of distinction. He planned and

    in 1794.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>
<p>It took its name from the town of Harwich in Essex,
    England. The word is derived from the Saxon terms, <i>hare</i>, &ldquo;an army&rdquo;, and <i>wich</i>, &ldquo;a strong place&rdquo;. At one
    time it was a fortified stronghold for troops.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Hastings</span>: county, Ontario, erected in 1792.</p>

    of Hastings, son of Sir John Rawdon, Earl of Moira and
    his third wife, Elizabeth Hastings, daughter of the ninth
    Earl of Huntingdon, 1754-1826. He gave the Empire
    distinguished military service in America and India.
    Rawdon succeeded to the Earldom of Moira in 1793 and
    was made Marquis of Hastings for his services as
    Governor of Bengal.</p>
<p>The Hastings family got its title from the town of
    Hastings in Sussex, England. It took its name from a
    Danish sea-captain who built a fort there in the Danish
    invasions of the ninth century.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Hawkesbury</span>: township (East and West) erected in
    1798, and thriving town in Prescott county, Ontario.</p>
<p>They were named in honour of Charles Jenkinson
    Baron Hawkesbury and Earl of Liverpool, (1727-1808).
    He was a friend of King George III., and Under Secretary
    of State for several years. His son, the second Lord
    Hawkesbury, was Premier of the Kingdom for fifteen
    years.</p>
<p>There are several villages by the name of Hawkesbury
    in England. The word is derived from Hawk, a man&rsquo;s
    name and old English <i>burg</i> meaning &ldquo;a castle&rdquo;, that is
    &ldquo;Hawk&rsquo;s castle&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Head</span>: township in Renfrew county, Ontario, formed
    in 1859.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Hearst</span>: town on C.N.R. in Cochrane district,
    Ontario.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Sir William Hearst, sometime
    Premier of Ontario. His Government passed the
    Ontario Temperance Act during the Great War, 1914-&rsquo;18.
    By the vote of the people this Act was rescinded in 1927
    and Government control of the sale of liquors instituted
    in its stead.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Hecate</span>: strait lying between Queen Charlotte islands
    and the mainland of British Columbia.</p>
<p>It was named after H.M.S. <i>Hecate</i> in B.C. coast
    survey service about 1860.</p>
<p>Hecate was a Grecian goddess represented with three
    heads. She was thought to have power from Zeus in
    heaven, earth, and sea. An offering of purification was
    made to her on the 30th of each month at three cross
    roads.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Hepworth</span>: pleasant village in Grey county, Ontario.</p>
<p>Apparently the name is derived, through a misuse of
    the aspirate, from Epworth, a small town in the county
    of Lincoln, England, from which doubtless some of the
    first settlers came. It is said to have been suggested by
    an English pioneer named Mr. Spencer. John Wesley,
    the founder of Methodism, was born there.</p>
<p>The word Epworth is derived from Eppa, a person&rsquo;s
    name, and old English <i>worth</i> meaning &ldquo;a farm&rdquo;, that
    is &ldquo;the farm of Eppa&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Herschel</span>: township in Hastings county, Ontario,

    Herschel, 1790-1871. He was the only son of Sir William
    Herschel, both distinguished astronomers. Sir John made
    a special study of the firmament of the southern hemisphere.

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Hespeler</span>: town in Waterloo county, Ontario. This
    town had its beginning in 1818 when Abram Clemens
    purchased 515 acres of Indian Lands from Richard
    Beasley. Of that acreage 464 acres are included in the
    incorporated town of Hespeler.</p>
<p>The first name given the settlement was Bergeyville
    after a settler named Michael Bergey. In 1835 the name
    was changed to New Hope. In 1844 Jacob Hespeler arrived
    and infused new life into the village. He built a
    saw mill, grist mill and a distillery, cleared the forests,
    drained the swamps and constructed roads. When the
    municipality was incorporated as a village in 1858 it was
    named Hespeler in honour of its most public-spirited
    citizen. The village became a town in 1901.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Hibbert</span>: township, Perth county, Ontario, erected in

    tactful, devoted to his superior&rsquo;s interests.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Himsworth</span>: township in Parry Sound district,
    Ontario, surveyed in 1876.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of William Alfred Himsworth,
    a member of the bar of Lower Canada. He was appointed
    Clerk of the Queen&rsquo;s Privy Council for Canada in 1872.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Hinchinbrooke</span>: township in Frontenac county,
    Ontario, organized in 1798.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>
<p>Hinchinbrooke is the name of a village in Huntingdon
    county, England. At one time Lord Nelson commanded a
    ship called the <i>Hinchinbrooke</i>. Viscount Hinchinbrooke,
    M.P. for Huntingdonshire, voted for the Canada Bill in
    1791.</p>
<p>Hinchinbrooke is also the name of a canton in Huntingdon
    county, Quebec.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Hincks</span>: canton in the county of Labelle, Quebec,
    erected in 1869.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Sir Francis Hincks, at one
    time Minister of Finance in the Government of Canada.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Hindon</span>: township in Haliburton district, Ontario,
    surveyed in 1860.</p>
<p>It took its name from the celebrated old town of Hindon
    in Wiltshire, England.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Hochelaga</span>: an Indian village or encampment on
    ground which now forms part of the site of Montreal,
    visited by Jacques Cartier in 1535. It consisted at that
    time of about fifty wooden dwellings, each about 150 feet
    long by 45 feet wide. Several families were accommodated
    in each house. The place was inhabited by one to
    two thousand natives. The village had a triple enclosure
    or palisade of circular form. Here and there were elevated
    structures, with piles of stones near by for defensive
    missiles.</p>
<p>Père Arnaud is of the opinion that the word Hochelaga
    is derived from the Iroquois <i>oshelaga</i>, meaning &ldquo;a
    place where one is surprised in an ambuscade and held
    in derision&rdquo;. M. l&rsquo;Abbé Manville states the word is a
    corruption of the Iroquois term <i>oserake</i> and that it may
    have any one of several meanings according to the context.
    The Iroquois language abounds in homonyms and
    one may take his choice in this case of the following:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>
<p>(a) The way to the beavers.</p>
<p>(b) Where they make hatchets.</p>
<p>(c) Where they pass the winter.</p>
<p>The name is preserved in Hochelaga county in which
    the city of Montreal is situated.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Holland</span>: township, Ontario, surveyed in 1840.</p>
<p>The origin of its name is uncertain. It may have been
    named after Major Samuel Holland who was with Wolfe
    at Louisbourg and Quebec, and afterwards became
    Surveyor-General of Canada. He died in 1801.</p>
<p>It is possible that it was named in honour of Lord
    Holland who was a member of the British Government at
    this period, 1835-&rsquo;41.</p>
<p>Holland is also the name of a historical river, York
    and Simcoe counties, Ontario, emptying into Lake Simcoe.
    It took its name from Major S. Holland who distinguished
    himself under Wolfe at Louisbourg and was appointed
    Surveyor-General of Canada.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Hooge</span>: mount, 10,550 feet, Rocky Mountains, Alberta.</p>
<p>It took its name from the village of Hooge, east of
    Ypres, where the Canadians took back from the Germans,
    June, 1916, ground which they had lost in the Ypres
    salient.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Hooker</span>: mount, 10,782 feet, situated at Athabaska
    Pass, Alberta and B.C.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Sir William Jackson
    Hooker, 1785-1865, celebrated British botanist, by David
    Douglas, Scottish botanist who crossed the Rocky
    Mountains in 1827.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Hope</span>: township in Durham county, Ontario, organized
    in 1792.</p>
<p>It is generally thought to have been named in honour
    of Colonel Henry Hope who commanded the British forces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span> in Canada in 1785. In the same year he was made acting
    Lieutenant-Governor of Canada and held this position
    until the arrival of Carleton as Governor-General in 1786.
    Hope then became Lieutenant-Governor of Quebec. He
    died in 1789 and was buried in the city of Quebec with
    military honours. As a mark of respect &ldquo;Hope Gate&rdquo;,
    upper town of Quebec, was named after him.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Horton</span>: township in Renfrew county, Ontario, erected
    in 1826.</p>
<p>It was named after R. J. Wilmot Horton, a member of
    the British House of Commons at this period. He supported
    a scheme to assist emigration to Canada.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Houghton</span>: township in Norfolk county, Ontario,
    formed in 1792.</p>
<p>It was called after Houghton in Norfolk county,
    England. Sir Robert Walpole resided here. The word is
    derived from <i>hough</i> meaning &ldquo;a hill&rdquo; and <i>ton</i>, &ldquo;a town&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Howard</span>: township in Kent county, Ontario, surveyed
    in 1794.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Thomas Howard, Earl of
    Effingham. His daughter, Lady Mary Howard, married
    Sir Guy Carleton, Governor-General of Canada at this
    period.</p>
<p>Howard is also the name of a village in Northumberland
    county, New Brunswick.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Sir Douglas Howard,
    Governor of this province in 1825.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Howe</span>: island in Lake Ontario, being a township of
    Frontenac county. It was surveyed in 1792.</p>
<p>Some authorities state it was named in honour of
    Richard, Earl Howe, a British Admiral, 1725-&rsquo;99. In 1782
    he relieved Gibraltar, besieged by the combined navies
    of France and Spain. Others think it was named after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span> the Admiral&rsquo;s brother, Sir William Howe, who served
    under Wolfe at Quebec and was Commander-in-Chief of
    the British forces in America, 1775-&rsquo;78.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Howick</span>: township in Huron county, Ontario, erected
    in 1850.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Henry George Grey who
    entered Parliament as Lord Howick in 1829. He was
    made Secretary for the Colonies in 1846. Near Howick,
    Northumberland county, England, is Howick Hall, the
    beautiful home of the Grey family. The word Howick
    is probably derived from the Danish <i>holde</i>, &ldquo;a fortress&rdquo;,
    and <i>wick</i>, &ldquo;a station or village&rdquo;, that is &ldquo;a fortified place&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Howland</span>: township in Manitoulin district, Ontario,
    surveyed in 1864.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Sir William Pearce Howland
    who represented West York in Parliament from 1857
    to 1868. He was a member of the Coalition Government
    of 1864 which worked out the scheme of Confederation.
    From 1868 to 1873 Sir William was Lieutenant-Governor
    of Ontario. He was knighted in 1879.</p>
<p>The Howland family was descended from John Howland,
    an English Quaker who came to America with the
    Puritan emigration in 1620. These people founded the
    free states of New England. The Bible was their law and
    brotherhood their charter. Sir William came to Canada
    from the United States in 1830 and took up mercantile
    business in Lambton Mills and Toronto.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Hudson</span>: bay and strait, northern Canada.</p>
<p>They are named in honour of their discoverer, Henry
    Hudson, a distinguished English navigator. His last
    voyage was made in 1610 when he entered this strait
    and bay and explored a portion of their coasts. Owing
    to scarcity of food his sailors mutinied and set Hudson,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span> his son, and seven infirm members of the crew adrift in
    a small boat. They were never heard from again. The
    mutineers reached England after much suffering.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Hull</span>: canton, erected in 1806, and a city, county of
    Ottawa, Quebec.</p>
<p>Philemon Wright, the founder of the city, named it
    after Hull in England. At a later date the name was
    extended to the canton or township.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Hullett</span>: township in Huron county, Ontario, organized
    in 1830.</p>
<p>It was named after John Hullet, a friend of John
    Galt, and one of the first directors of the Canada Land
    Company.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Humber</span>: river, teeming with historical romance, in
    York county, Ontario.</p>
<p>Before Governor Simcoe&rsquo;s time it was known as
    Toronto River, and St. John&rsquo;s creek after Jean Baptiste
    Rousseau, an early trader and interpreter, who had a
    public house on its banks, near Dundas Street. Simcoe
    disliked the aboriginal name of Toronto and ordered it to
    be replaced by Humber. &ldquo;The north of England names
    began to be in use, and the Humber, with perhaps some
    influence added from that Humber near his Devonshire
    estate, displaced the Toronto and St. John&rsquo;s Creek&rdquo;&mdash;K.
    M. Lizars in <i>The Valley of the Humber</i>.</p>
<p>The word Humber is probably the aspirated form of <i>cumber</i> (Danish) denoting the confluence of the Ouse and
    Trent Rivers.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Humberstone</span>: township in Welland county, Ontario,
    formed in 1787.</p>
<p>It took its name from Humberston, a village in
    Lincolnshire, England, five miles from the seaport town<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span> of Great Grimsby. It is also the name of a pleasant
    village in this township.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Humphry</span>: township, Parry Sound district, Ontario,
    surveyed in 1866.</p>
<p>The origin of the name is unknown. Boswell in his <i>Life of Johnson</i> speaks of Ozias Humphry as an eminent
    painter of the period.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Hungerford</span>: township in Hastings county, Ontario,
    erected in 1798.</p>
<p>Hungerford took its name from a title of the Hastings
    family. Edward Hastings was summoned to Parliament
    in 1482 as Baron Hungerford. The title was taken from
    the town of Hungerford in Berkshire.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Hunter</span>: township in Nipissing district, Ontario,
    surveyed in 1881.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of James Hill Hunter, M.P.P.
    for South Grey. Mr. Hunter was first elected to the
    Legislature in 1875. He was engaged in the mercantile
    business in Durham village.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Huntingdon</span>: county in southern Quebec.</p>
<p>It took its name, by proclamation of 1792, from the
    shire of Huntingdon, England.</p>
<p>Huntington township, Hastings county, Ontario, was
    organized in 1798. Its origin is the same as Huntingdon,
    only a &ldquo;t&rdquo; has been substituted for the &ldquo;d&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Huntley</span>: township in Carleton county, Ontario,
    surveyed in 1823.</p>
<p>It took its name from Huntley Castle, Aberdeen county,
    Scotland, the girlhood home of Lady Charlotte Gordon,
    wife of the Duke of Richmond, Governor-General of
    Canada, 1818-&rsquo;19. The word is a corruption of hunting
    and lea, &ldquo;a meadow&rdquo;, originally &ldquo;a hunting ground&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Huntsville</span>: thriving town in Muskoka district,
    Ontario. It possesses a superb situation for scenic
    beauty at the gateway of the Lake of Bays and is the
    centre of numerous summer resorts. Half a century ago
    the red man was the sole enjoyer of this district&rsquo;s
    beauties.</p>
<p>The town took its name from one of the first white
    settlers, George Hunt.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Huron</span>: a great lake, a county organized in 1841, and
    a township of the same county, in Ontario. It is also the
    name of a river flowing into the Richelieu River, Quebec.</p>
<p>Father Lalement, writing in 1639, states that about
    1600, a French soldier, seeing a party of Indians
    (Wyandottes) with their hair cropped and silver-coloured,
    dubbed them &ldquo;Hurons&rdquo;. This word is derived from
    the French <i>hure</i> meaning bristly. The manner in
    which they dressed their hair suggested the bristles of
    the wild boar.</p>
<p>The Wyandottes or Hurons at first occupied the northern
    shores of the St. Lawrence westward from Montreal
    and afterwards the country between Lake Simcoe and
    Matchedash Bay. The Iroquois waged war against them
    here and drove them still westward to Manitoulin Island
    in the lake that now bears the name Huron, to Michilimackinac,
    and the northern shores of Lake Superior.</p>

    Quebec, and canton, county of Saguenay, Quebec, erected
    in 1860, and also the name of a lake in northern Quebec.</p>
<p>They were named in honour of Pierre Le Moyne
    d&rsquo;Iberville who distinguished himself in expeditions to
    Hudson&rsquo;s Bay.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Ile-aux-Coudres</span>: island in the St. Lawrence River,
    county of Charlevoix, Quebec.</p>
<p>The words are French, meaning &ldquo;island of nuts&rdquo;.
    This island was discovered by Cartier in 1535 and so
    named on account of the abundance of hazel-nuts he
    found on it.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Ile d&rsquo;Orleans</span>: island in the River St. Lawrence,
    Montmorency county, Quebec.</p>
<p>On the 7th of September, 1535, Cartier discovered
    this large and fertile island. He gave it the name of
    Bacchus (in mythology the son of Jupiter and god of
    wine) on account of finding it covered with wild grapes.
    The name was afterwards changed to Orleans, some
    writers say by Cartier on his third voyage in 1541, in
    honour of the Royal Family of France.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Illecillewaet</span>: glacier, mining district, village and river
    flowing into Columbia River at Revelstoke, Kootenay,
    British Columbia.</p>
<p>The name is Indian, meaning &ldquo;swift water&rdquo;, originally
    applied to the river only.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Ingersoll</span>: thriving and picturesque town in Oxford
    county, Ontario.</p>
<p>It was named after Colonel Charles Ingersoll, a U.E.
    Loyalist, who settled in this district in 1793. He became
    the first postmaster of the village of Ingersoll in 1821.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Innisfil</span>: township in Simcoe county, Ontario, surveyed
    in 1822.</p>
<p>The word is a shortened form of Innisfail, one of the
    poetical names for Ireland.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Iona</span>: town and parish in Victoria county, Cape
    Breton, Nova Scotia. It was settled by Scotch in 1802.</p>
<p>Bishop McKeown gave it this name in 1873 on account
    of its physical features resembling those of Iona, Scotland.
    The name was confirmed by Parliament in 1891.</p>
<p>The word Iona is said to be Hebrew for Jonas, the
    prophet.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Iroquois</span>: town in Dundas county, Ontario.</p>
<p>It took its name from one of the principal Indian
    tribes of North America, called by the French &ldquo;Iroquois&rdquo;
    and by the British the Six Nations. The Iroquois Confederacy
    was composed of the Mohawks, Oneidas, Onondagas,
    Senecas, Cayugas and Tuscaroras. It was formed
    about 1540 for mutual protection, and was successfully
    maintained for 200 years. The union was never formally
    dissolved. The Indian name of this league was Ho-de-no-saw-nee,
    or &ldquo;People of the Long House&rdquo;. It is said the
    structure of this league suggested the union of the thirteen
    English colonies in the Revolutionary War of 1776-&rsquo;83&mdash;a
    union which developed into the United States of
    America.</p>
<p>The origin of the Iroquois is obscure. Most authorities
    state this tribe came originally from the vicinity of
    Hudson Bay by way of the Ottawa and Saguenay in the
    days long agone, as a small nation, and settled along the
    north shore of the St. Lawrence, from Hochelaga to
    Stadacona, among the Hurons and Algonquins, from
    whom they learned the arts of husbandry and the tactics
    of war. Becoming numerous they rose against their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span> masters but were compelled to seek fresh fields and
    settled in the district now known as the State of New
    York.</p>
<p>Charlevoix derives the word Iroquois from <i>hiro</i>, &ldquo;I
    have spoken&rdquo;, and <i>koue</i> which when long drawn out is a
    cry of sorrow and when briefly uttered an exclamation
    of joy. With these words, according to Charlevoix, the
    orators of this tribe were in the habit of closing all their
    public speeches.</p>
<p>Horatio Hale objects to the French compound and
    states that the term Iroquois is a modification of <i>Ierokwa</i>,
    meaning, &ldquo;They who smoke&rdquo; or briefly the &ldquo;Tobacco
    People&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Dr. Benjamin Suite of Ottawa states that an Iroquois
    chief at Caughnawaga near Montreal told him Iro was not
    used at the close of an address but was a salutation on
    entering a room where there was company and that it
    meant, &ldquo;here&rdquo;, &ldquo;here I am&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Ishbel</span>: mount 9,440 feet high in the Rockies, ten miles
    from Banff.</p>
<p>This mountain was named in honour of Miss
    Ishbel MacDonald, eldest daughter of the British Premier,
    Ramsay MacDonald, who accompanied her father on his
    visit to Canada in the autumn of 1929. On the morning
    of the 25th of December of that year Premier Mackenzie
    King cabled the distinction to the delighted family at their
    Scottish home, Hillocks, at Lossiemouth, as Canada&rsquo;s
    Christmas gift to this popular and capable young woman.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Isle-aux-Noix</span>: island, county of St. John, Quebec,
    where Lake Champlain narrows into the Richelieu River.
    Both the French and the English considered it a strategic
    point for military operations and built fortifications on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span> the Island. Many a fierce encounter took place on both
    the water and the land of this locality during the American
    War of Independence (1775-&rsquo;83), and the War of
    1812-&rsquo;15.</p>
<p>The name is French meaning in English &ldquo;Island of
    Walnuts&rdquo;. The walnut tree flourished here in early days
    and bore nuts in great profusion.</p>
<p>There are three kinds of walnuts; the black walnut
    of North America, the grey walnut or butternut also of
    America, and the European walnut, a native of Persia,
    whose nuts are superior to any other.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Jacques Cartier</span>: county, lake, and river in Quebec.
    It is most fitting that the discoverer of Canada in 1535
    should have his name thus commemorated. His name and
    that of the Huron Indian village of Hochelaga which he
    visited on this occasion are borne by the two counties of
    the island of Montreal.</p>
<p>The river known as Jacques Cartier was visited by
    Champlain in 1603 and so named by him under the impression
    that the Admiral and his company of three ships
    had wintered in its mouth in 1535-&rsquo;36. Later he decided
    from ruins found on its banks that Cartier had wintered
    in the St. Charles (St. Croix), or rather in its tributary
    St. Michel or Lairet. Here in 1843 was found the hull of
    his vessel &ldquo;Petite Hermione&rdquo; left behind on his return to
    France.</p>
<p><span class="bold">James</span>: bay, north of central Canada, an arm of
    Hudson Bay. It was discovered by Captain Thomas
    James.</p>
<p>In May, 1631, Captain James sailed from Bristol in a
    70-ton vessel, the <i>Mary</i>, furnished and equipped by the
    enterprising merchants of that city, with a crew of twenty
    men and two boys. He passed through Hudson Strait
    and reached the north-west portion of Hudson Bay.
    Working south and east in quest of the north-west passage,
    he had the honour of discovering that deep bay
    which still bears his name.</p>
<p>James and his heroic seamen wintered on Charlton
    Island deep down in the bay. Their sufferings from cold
    and scurvy beggars description. The good ship <i>Mary</i> was much buffeted and broken by the Arctic gales and
    ice, but she brought them safely home in triumph the
    next summer.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>
<p>The ship was named in honour of Princess Mary,
    daughter of Charles I. She married William, Prince of
    Orange, and became mother of William III., King of
    England (1688-1702).</p>
<p><span class="bold">Jasper</span>: village, lake and national park, Athabaska
    River, Alberta.</p>
<p>They were named after Jasper House which was a

    Hawes, 1817.</p>
<p>Jasper Park was set aside in 1907 by the federal
    government for the perpetual use, benefit and enjoyment
    of the people. It contains 4,400 square miles, and is the
    largest of the fourteen federal reservations for park
    purposes. It is historic ground, many early explorers
    having passed this way to the Pacific, among them
    David Thompson in 1810.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Johnstown</span>: hamlet situated on the St. Lawrence
    River in Grenville county, Ontario, and former name of
    a district in Upper Canada, embracing the present counties
    of Leeds and Grenville and parts of two townships
    in each of the counties of Lanark and Carleton.</p>
<p>They took their name from the celebrated U.E. Loyalist,
    Sir William Johnson. Before the Thirteen Colonies
    declared their Independence in 1776, Rev. John Stuart,
    D.D., Episcopal clergyman, had been missionary to the
    Mohawks in the state of New York. Sir William Johnson
    (married Molly Brant, sister of Chief Joseph Brant)
    secured from Governor Clinton a grant of land for him
    which Dr. Stuart named Johnstown in honour of his
    patron. In consequence of his loyalty to the British
    Crown, Stuart had to remove to Canada in 1781. The
    Government granted him land in Grenville county, which
    he named New Johnstown, the village subsequently be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>coming
    the first capital (county town) and giving its
    name to the entire district. Here in 1792 Simcoe was
    given a royal reception.</p>
<p>The Dominion Government has recently decided
    (1928) to expropriate this land of historical associations
    along the shore of the St. Lawrence from Windmill Point
    to Johnstown Creek on which to erect the Great Lakes
    Grain Terminal, and has opened (1930) Port Johnstown
    post-office.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Jolliett</span>: canton in the counties of Jolliette and
    Berthier, Quebec.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Louis Jolliett, the discoverer
    of the Mississippi River in 1673. He was born at
    Quebec in 1645 and educated for the priesthood. Talon,
    the Intendant, and Frontenac, the Governor, chose Jolliett
    to explore the Mississippi. He asked Father Marquette
    to accompany him, and together they reached their goal
    by way of the Fox and Wisconsin Rivers. The explorers
    proceeded down the great river as far as the mouth of the
    Arkansas tributary where they were compelled to retrace
    their course, owing to the unfriendliness of the Indians.
    As a reward for his services he was granted the island of
    Anticosti. He died there about 1701.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Jolliette</span>: county in the province of Quebec, surveyed
    in 1864.</p>
<p>It was named after the Hon. Barthelmy Joliette,

<h2><a name="K" id="K">K</a></h2>
<p><span class="bold">Kaien</span>: island, Tuck inlet, Chatham sound, British
    Columbia. It was selected in 1905 as the western
    terminus of the Grand Trunk Pacific railway, now a
    division of the C.N.R. See <i>Prince Rupert</i>.</p>
<p>The name is Indian and means &ldquo;foam&rdquo;. In the channel
    at the south end of the island there is a strong rapid
    and during a storm, foam extends at times a mile or so
    along the shore, hence the name.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Kakabeka</span>: the beautiful Kakabeka Falls occur on the
    Kaministikwia River.</p>
<p>The word is a corruption of Indian <i>Kakapikank</i>, and
    signifies &ldquo;high fall&rdquo;. (<i>Picturesque Canada</i>, p. 270.)</p>
<p><span class="bold">Kaladar</span>: township in Addington county, Ontario,
    erected in 1820.</p>
<p>The origin of this name is uncertain. Some writers
    think the word may be derived from an East Indian word, <i>Killahdar</i> or <i>Killedar</i>, meaning &ldquo;the Governor of a Fort&rdquo;.
    Kalandar is a term applied to a vagrant saint in India.
    There is a tradition in the township that its name is a
    corruption of &ldquo;kill a deer&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Kaministikwia</span>: river emptying into Lake Superior,
    Thunder Bay district, Ontario.</p>
<p>The word is Indian, meaning &ldquo;the river with short
    bends and many islands&rdquo;, according to the Geographic
    Board of Canada.</p>
<p>This word is sometimes written Kaministiquia, and
    according to some Indian headmen of the district it is
    a corruption of <i>Kaw-maw-naw-taw-quaw</i> which applied
    to both river and valley through which it flows, and means
    &ldquo;The place where there is always plenty of game&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Kamloops</span>: city in the Yale district, B.C. In 1912 it
    celebrated its centenary.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>
<p>In May, 1812, Alexander Ross of the Pacific Fur Co.
    established a trading post here and named it Cumeloups
    which is Indian for &ldquo;the meeting of the waters&rdquo;. At
    this point is the junction of the South Thompson and
    North Thompson Rivers. A post office was opened here
    in 1872 under the name of Kamloops.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Kapuskasing</span>: enterprising town in Timiskaming
    district, and picturesque river, tributary to Mattagami
    River, Algoma and Timiskaming districts, Ontario.</p>
<p>Kapuskasing is a Cree Indian word meaning &ldquo;branch&rdquo;
    river.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Kaslo</span>: city and river in southern British Columbia.</p>
<p>The city was named in 1890 after the river of the same
    name by the pioneer settlers. The postmaster, D. P.
    Kane, states that the river was named after himself by a
    Frenchman, John Kaslo, who came up the Kootenay
    Lake to the head, looking for placer gold, in the days of
    the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Kawartha</span>: group of beautiful lakes extending across
    Victoria and Peterborough counties, Ontario. They are
    fourteen in number: Scugog, Sturgeon, Cameron, Balsam,
    Pigeon, Bald, Sandy, Buckhorn, Chemong, Deer, Lovesick,
    Stony, Clear and Katchewanooka.</p>
<p>The word Kawartha is Huron Indian, meaning &ldquo;bright
    waters and happy lands&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Kelowna</span>: city in Yale district, B.C.</p>
<p>The name is an Indian word meaning &ldquo;grizzly bear&rdquo;.
    It was given by the late John Coryell, C.E., of the firm of
    Coryell and Burnyeat of Vernon who surveyed the site of
    the city in 1891-&rsquo;92 for Legume Bros., the owners of the
    land. The post office was opened February 1, 1893.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Kempenfelt</span>: bay, an arm of Lake Simcoe, Simcoe
    county, Ontario.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>
<p>It was named by Lieutenant-Governor Simcoe in honour
    of Rear-Admiral Richard Kempenfelt, 1718-&rsquo;82.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Kemptville</span>: town in Grenville county, Ontario.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Sir James Kempt,
    Governor-General of Canada, 1828-&rsquo;30. He made no
    radical changes, disappointing those who hoped he would
    support an elective legislative council.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Kennebec</span>: township in Frontenac county, Ontario,
    formed in 1823.</p>
<p>Its origin is somewhat uncertain. Most authorities
    state the word is Abenakis Indian, meaning &ldquo;a snake&rdquo;,
    others &ldquo;deep river&rdquo;. In combination may be the solution&mdash;a
    river infested with snakes. Abbé Maurault in his <i>History of the Abenakis</i> states the word is derived from
    Kanibeseck, meaning &ldquo;the path which leads to the lake&rdquo;
    (Megantic). There is a Kennebec river in Maine which
    takes its rise in Lake Megantic, and U.E. Loyalists came
    to Upper Canada from its immediate neighbourhood.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Kennebecasis</span>: river in New Brunswick, an affluent of
    the River St. John.</p>
<p>The word is Maliseet Indian, Ken-a-bee-kay-sis, but
    its meaning is uncertain. It is supposed to be a diminutive
    of Kennebec (river in Maine, U.S.A.), that is, little
    Kennebec, and Kennebec is variously stated to mean &ldquo;long
    river&rdquo;, &ldquo;deep river&rdquo;, and &ldquo;snake&rdquo;, any one of which is
    applicable to a certain extent.</p>
<p>The name is pronounced locally, Ken-ne-bec-ay-shus.
    Tradition says the word had the following origin. Two
    travellers arrived at a tavern on the river&rsquo;s banks on a
    stormy night, and one remarked as they drew near, &ldquo;Can
    it be Case&rsquo;s?&rdquo; It is said a family by the name of Case
    still keeps a public house on the banks of the Kennebecasis.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>
<p>Kennebecasis Bay at the mouth of the river is the
    scene of the legend of the beaver pond from which the
    Indian demigod Glooscap formed some of the adjoining
    physical features while chastising the great beavers for
    misconduct.</p>
<p>The Maliseets or Malicites occupied the St. John
    River district mainly and were so called by the Micmacs.
    The word means &ldquo;broken talkers&rdquo;, &ldquo;those who speak
    badly&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The Micmacs lived in Gaspé, northern New Brunswick,
    Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia. The name
    of this tribe is French and means, &ldquo;secret practice&rdquo;,
    &ldquo;underhand dealing&rdquo;. These people were so designated,
    it is supposed, because of the large number of &ldquo;medicine
    men&rdquo; found among them.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Kenora</span>: flourishing town in Kenora district, Ontario.</p>
<p>The town was originally called Rat Portage, and a
    large district now included in Manitoba and Ontario was
    called Keewatin, &ldquo;home of the north-west wind&rdquo;. Near
    Rat Portage was the village of Norman. About 1899 by
    Act of Parliament they united under the name of Kenora.
    The new name was made up of the first two letters of
    Keewatin, Norman and Rat Portage. There is also the
    town of Keewatin three miles from Kenora.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Kent</span>: county in Ontario, surveyed in 1792.</p>
<p>It took its name from the beautiful county of Kent in
    England. The Teutonic Kingdom of Kent was founded
    by the Jutes after they had driven out the Britons about
    450 A.D. Their chief city was called Cant-wara-byrig or
    Kentmensborough, now the city of Canterbury.</p>
<p>There is also a county of Kent in New Brunswick. It
    was named in honour of Prince Edward, Duke of Kent,
    father of Her Majesty, Queen Victoria.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Kenyon</span>: township in Glengarry county, Ontario,
    erected in 1798.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Lloyd, Lord Kenyon, a
    distinguished Welsh lawyer, born at Gredington, county
    of Flint, Wales, in 1739, died 1802. Pitt made him Chief-Justice
    of the King&rsquo;s Bench in 1788 with the title of Lord
    Kenyon, Baron of Gredington.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Keppel</span>: township in Grey county, Ontario, surveyed
    in 1853.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Captain Henry Keppel of
    the British navy. After many years of distinguished
    service, chiefly on the China and Japan station, he was
    made an Admiral in 1869.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Kicking Horse</span>: pass, and river, branch of Columbia
    River, Kootenay district, B.C.</p>
<p>In 1859 Sir James Hector was kicked by one of his
    horses near Wapta railway station. The name was given
    by his men. The pass is on the line of the C. P. R.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Kildonan</span>: historic parish in Manitoba, a few miles
    north of Winnipeg, founded by some of Selkirk&rsquo;s settlers
    from the Hebrides in 1812. There are parishes or villages
    by the name of Kildonan in Arran, Eigg, Skye and
    Sutherlandshire. The word is derived from the Gaelic <i>cil</i> (kil), &ldquo;church&rdquo; and St. Donan, &ldquo;the church of St.
    Donan&rdquo;. He was a friend of Columba and met a martyr&rsquo;s
    death at Eigg in 617.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Killarney</span>: a picturesque village on the shore of
    Georgian Bay, Parry Sound district, Ontario, also a village
    in Manitoba and a settlement in B.C. All were
    named after Killarney, Ireland.</p>
<p>The word is derived from the Celtic <i>cil</i> or <i>kil</i> meaning
    &ldquo;church&rdquo; and <i>larney</i>, meaning &ldquo;black thorn or sloe&rdquo;, that
    is &ldquo;the church among the black thorns&rdquo;. In early days a
    church was the centre around which a village grew.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Kincardine</span>: township in Bruce county, Ontario,
    erected in 1849, and also a town situated on Lake Huron
    in the same county.</p>
<p>They took their name from the shire of Kincardine,
    east coast of Scotland.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Kindersley</span>: town in Saskatchewan, first division
    point on C.N.R. between Saskatoon and Calgary.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Sir Robert Kindersley,
    representative of Lazard Bros. great financial firm of
    London, Paris and New York. By his advice that house
    under-wrote millions of dollars&rsquo; worth of Canadian Northern
    Securities while the Road was still under construction.</p>
<p><span class="bold">King</span>: township in York county, Ontario, formed in
    1798.</p>
<p>The origin of the name is uncertain. Some ascribe
    the honour to Mr. John King, Under Secretary of State at
    this period. His correspondence with public men of
    Canada at this time is to be found in the Archives. Dr.
    Henry Scadding was of the opinion that this township was
    named after Sir Richard King, an Admiral in the British
    Navy.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Kings</span>: county in New Brunswick and also in Prince
    Edward Island.</p>
<p>They were so named as an expression of loyalty to the
    Monarch, King George III.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Kingston</span>: city, Frontenac county, Ontario, occupies
    the site of the Indian village of Cataraqui and of the fort
    which Count de Frontenac, Governor of Canada, built in
    1672. The English village of Kingston was founded in
    1784 by U.E. Loyalists.</p>
<p>Kingston township was outlined in 1783 and sub-divided
    into lots in 1784 by John Collins, land surveyor, at
    the direction of General Haldimand, Governor of Canada.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span> Both city and township were named Kingstown (afterwards
    contracted to Kingston) in honour of King George
    III.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Kinloss</span>: township in Bruce county, Ontario, erected
    in 1850.</p>
<p>It took its name from Kinloss, a parish and hamlet on
    Moray Firth, Elginshire, Scotland. The ruins of the
    beautiful Abbey of Kinloss are still to be seen. It was
    built in 1170 by David I. for the Cistercians. He was
    lost while out hunting and was led here by a white dove in
    answer to his prayers.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Kitchener</span>: city in Waterloo county, Ontario, so named
    in 1916 after Field-Marshal Lord Kitchener.</p>
<p>Joseph Schneider from Pennsylvania is said to have
    been the first settler in 1807. The earliest name was Sand
    Hills and later Mount Pleasant. In honour of some
    settlers arriving about 1830 direct from Germany the
    name was changed to Berlin.</p>
<p>Horatio Herbert Kitchener was born in 1850 at
    Gunsborough House near Listowel, Kerry county, Ireland.
    The family motto was &ldquo;Thorough&rdquo;, which marked his
    military career. His achievements in Egypt, in the Soudan,

    Secretary of State for War. On the 5th of June, 1916,
    he set out on an important mission to Russia. On the
    same day he was drowned at sea when the <i>Hampshire</i> was wrecked off the Orkney Islands. What more fitting
    sepulchre for Britian&rsquo;s great son!</p>

<p><span class="bold">Kitley</span>: township in Leeds county, Ontario, surveyed
    in 1798.</p>
<p>It was called after Kitley, near Yeolhampton, in
    Devonshire, England. Kitley was the residence of the
    ancient family of Bastard after whom Bastard township

<p><span class="bold">Klondike</span>: village and small river, tributary to the
    Yukon River, Yukon Territory.</p>
<p>The famous Klondike placer-gold region lies in the
    basins of the Klondike and Indian Rivers. Gold was discovered

    the precious metal reached $20,000,000. The region is
    well-wooded. The summers are warm and the winters
    vigorous.</p>
<p>The name Klondike is derived from Indian Throndiuk
    meaning &ldquo;river full of fish&rdquo;.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Labrador</span>: coast district on the north-east boundary
    of Quebec Province, forming a dependency of Newfoundland.</p>
<p>Authors do not agree as to the exact meaning or
    origin of the word Labrador. Gosling in his <i>History of
    Labrador</i> states that in 1501 Henry VII. gave letters
    patent granting certain privileges in the New World to
    three merchants of Bristol and three farmers or labourers
    from the Azores by name Gonzales and the two Fernandez.
    On the voyage out Juan Fernandez was the first to
    sight this land and the sailors dubbed it Lavrador or
    Labrador, the Portuguese word for labour.</p>
<p>Dr. N. E. Dionne in his book <i>La Nouvelle France de
    Cartier à Champlain</i> is inclined to think that the Spaniards
    and even the Portuguese may have translated <i>Terre
    de Labour</i>, primitively given by the Basques to this part
    of their discoveries, by the word Labrador. Labour is a
    small territory in southern France, situated between
    Gascony and the Basque country.</p>
<p>Kingsford in his <i>History of Canada</i> says that the
    word is a corruption of <i>Laboratores terrae</i>, so called because
    in the year 1500 Cortereal seized a cargo of fifty
    natives and sold them in Europe for slaves.</p>
<p>Other writers derive the word from the Spanish
    phrase, <i>Tierra Labrador</i>, &ldquo;the farmers&rsquo; or labourer&rsquo;s
    land&rdquo;, it being less barren than Greenland. Monseigneur
    Charles Gway in an article published in 1903 agrees with
    this derivation but states that it is evident the name was
    given in derision to this tract of waste land.</p>
<p>Another origin that has been suggested is the French
    phrase <i>le bras d&rsquo;or</i>, &ldquo;the arm of gold&rdquo;. Most early explorers
    were in quest of the precious metal and the natives
    informed those who gave the name that their land<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span> abounded in the golden ore. If this be the origin, the
    name has so far proved a misnomer. As recently as 1924
    discovery of rich gold mines was reported, but prospectors
    who rushed to the scene were disappointed.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Lachine</span>: rapids, canal, city, on the St. Lawrence
    River, a few miles west of Montreal.</p>
<p>The devoted and ambitious La Salle was granted a site
    here in 1667 by the Sulpician Fathers on which to erect a
    fortified outpost for the defense of the city of Montreal.
    He, or some jocular pragmatist, named his clearing and
    settlement La Chine (thither the way to China), thus
    embalming his dominant idea of a passage across the
    continent to the Indies and Cathay (the name by which
    China was known to Europeans in the middle ages).
    Tiring in two or three years of this uneventful life, La
    Salle sold out his concession and entered upon his voyages
    of discovery.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Ladysmith</span>: city, Vancouver Island, B.C.</p>
<p>It was named in 1900 by James Dunsmuir, owner at
    that time of extensive coal mines in this district, after
    Ladysmith in South Africa when he heard of its relief by
    the British army after it had been besieged for several
    months by the Boers. Before this time the town was
    known as Oyster Harbour on which Ladysmith is situated.
    The name was officially changed on January 1, 1901.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Lake</span>: township in Hastings county, Ontario, formed
    in 1822.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Viscount Gerard Lake,
    1744-1808, a soldier of distinction. He was commander
    of the British force which suppressed the rebellion of
    1798 in Ireland by his defeat of the insurgents at Vinegar
    Hill, Wexford county. Lake also conducted the campaign
    in India against the Mogul Emperor, bringing it to a close
    by the capture of Delhi in 1803.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Lambton</span>: county in Ontario, organized in 1850, and
    also a canton in Frontenac county, Quebec, erected in
    1848.</p>
<p>They were named in honour of Sir John George Lambton,
    Earl of Durham, 1792-1840. In 1838 he was
    appointed Governor-General of Canada, and Her Majesty&rsquo;s
    High Commissioner to enquire into the public affairs
    of the country. Durham arrived at Quebec, May 29,
    1838, and departed November 1st of the same year. His
    voluminous and illuminating Report which resulted in the
    union of the two Canadas and the establishment of our
    free municipal system was dated January 31, 1839.
    Canada owes a great debt to the Earl of Durham&rsquo;s discernment,
    judgment and courage.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Lanark</span>: county in Ontario, organized in 1825, and
    also a township in this county, formed in 1820.</p>
<p>They are named after Lanark, the county-town of
    Lanarkshire, Scotland. It was in Lanark that William
    Wallace commenced his military efforts to break Edward
    I.&rsquo;s power in Scotland. There is a statue of the hero in the
    Lanark parish church.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Lancaster</span>: thriving village and township in Glengarry
    county, Ontario, erected in 1787.</p>
<p>They were named after the county of Lancaster in
    England, and in honour of King George III., one of whose
    titles was Duke of Lancaster.</p>
<p>The name means &ldquo;the fortress or stronghold on the
    River Lune&rdquo; (Lancashire). The word is derived from
    Celtic <i>lon</i>, meaning, &ldquo;marsh, pool, stream&rdquo; and Latin <i>castrum</i> &ldquo;a fortress&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Lansdowne</span>: township, Leeds county, Ontario, surveyed
    in 1788.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Major-General William
    Petty Fitzmaurice, Earl of Shelbourne, 1737-1805, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span> distinguished soldier and statesman. He was Secretary
    of State in 1766 and had an extensive correspondence
    with Governor Haldimand about affairs in Canada.
    This statesman voted against the Stamp Act, sought to
    remove the grievances of the Thirteen Colonies and
    strongly opposed the granting of Independence. Fitzmaurice
    was created Marquis of Lansdowne in 1784.
    The title was probably taken from Lansdowne Road,
    Dublin, his birthplace. Henry Charles Keith Petty
    Fitzmaurice, fifth Marquis of Lansdowne, was Governor-General
    of Canada, 1888-&rsquo;93.</p>
<p>Lansdowne is also the name of a pleasant village on
    the C.N.R. in this township.</p>
<p><span class="bold">La Prairie</span>: county in Quebec. This district was
    originally given to the Jesuits in which to establish a
    mission by an Abbé of the Church of the Magdalene,
    Paris, a member of the One Hundred Associates.</p>
<p>Its first name was La Prairie de la Magdeleine, the
    land of Magdalene.</p>
<p><span class="bold">L&rsquo;Assomption</span>: county, town, river, and lake in
    Quebec. On some maps it is printed Assomption, meaning
    in English Assumption.</p>
<p>It is the name given to a festival celebrated on the 15th
    of August by the Roman Catholic Church, commemorating
    the taking up into heaven of the Virgin Mary in body
    and soul. The word is derived from the Latin <i>ad</i>, to, <i>sumere</i>, to take up, and <i>ion</i>, act of.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Lauder</span>: township in Nipissing district, Ontario,
    erected in 1881.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Abram William Lauder, a
    resident of Toronto and M.P.P. for South Grey from
    1867 until his death. Mr. Lauder supported the coalition
    government of John Sandfield Macdonald and was henceforth
    known as one of the &ldquo;nine martyrs&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Laurentides</span>: mountain ranges or hills that divide the
    St. Lawrence basin from the watershed of Hudson&rsquo;s Bay.
    They extend in an irregular curve from Labrador to the
    Arctic, a distance of 3000 miles. This great angular
    belt is the nucleus of the continent of North America. It
    consists of two broad bands or ridges meeting in the
    region of the Great Lakes. These rocks belong to the
    archaean system (gneiss, quartzites, schists).</p>
<p>The word Laurentides is derived from (Saint) Laurent,
    the French form of Lawrence. It is said to have
    been coined by Garneau, the Canadian historian. Doubtless
    our poets appreciated its rhyming elements. On some
    maps these ranges are called the Laurentian Mountains.

<p><span class="bold">Laurier</span>: township in Parry Sound district, Ontario,
    surveyed in 1878. Laurier is also the name of a lake in
    Kenora district, Ontario, a mount, Yukon Territory, a
    peak 11,750 feet, in B.C., and a river emptying into
    Clinton-Colden Lake, Mackenzie district, and of twelve
    other places in Canada, seventeen in all.</p>
<p>They are named in honour of Right Hon. Sir Wilfrid
    Laurier, (1841-1919), Prime Minister of Canada from
    1896 to 1911. He was born at St. Lin, Quebec, and
    educated at L&rsquo;Assomption College and McGill University.
    Mr. Laurier entered the House of Commons in 1874. A
    feature of his first Administration was the inauguration
    of a British preferential tariff in 1897. Sir Wilfrid&rsquo;s
    parliamentary career was distinguished by urbanity, ripe
    scholarship, elevated statesmanship, and uprightness of
    character.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Lavallee</span>: canton in Champlain county, Quebec.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Calixa Lavallee, 1842-&rsquo;91,
    musician. He composed the air of the national hymn, &ldquo;O<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span> Canada!&rdquo; His first appearance as a concert-pianist was
    at the age of ten years. He entered Paris Conservatory
    when fifteen years of age. Returning to America,
    Lavallee had a distinguished musical career in the United
    States. His compositions included two operas, an oratorio,
    a cantata, a symphony, and several overtures and
    piano-pieces.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Lavant</span>: township in Lanark county, Ontario, organized
    in 1823.</p>
<p>It took its name from the village of Lavant, near
    Goodwood, in the shire of Sussex, England. In Goodwood
    Park was the beautiful home of the Richmond family.
    While touring this section of Upper Canada, Charles
    Lennox, the fourth Duke of Richmond, Governor-General
    of Canada, 1818-&rsquo;19, died from hydrophobia. It was his
    wife who gave the military ball at Brussels, on the eve of
    Waterloo, which Byron celebrated in &ldquo;Childe Harold&rdquo;.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Lawrence</span>: township in Haliburton district, Ontario,
    formed in 1877.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Sir John Laird Mair
    Lawrence, 1811-&rsquo;79, who rendered distinguished service
    in India at the time of the Mutiny. He was Governor-General
    of the Indian Empire from 1863 to 1868.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Laxton</span>: township in Victoria county, Ontario, erected
    in 1858.</p>
<p>It is said to have been named after the village of Laxton
    in the county of Northampton, England.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Leaside</span>: flourishing modern industrial town in the
    northern suburbs of Toronto.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>
<p>It was named after the Lea family who settled in
    this district about 130 years ago.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Leeds</span>: county in Ontario, organized in 1792, and a
    township in the same county surveyed in 1785.</p>
<p>Both were named in honour of Francis Godolphin
    Osborne, fifth Duke of Leeds, Secretary of State for the
    Home Department in the British Government at the
    period. The founder of this historic family was Edward
    Osborne who, when a young apprentice to Sir William
    Hewett, jumped from London Bridge to rescue from
    drowning the young daughter of his master. He afterwards
    married the girl he had saved and in later life
    became Lord Mayor of London and Member of Parliament.
    The family title is taken from the city of Leeds in
    Yorkshire.</p>
<p>Leeds is also the name of a canton in Megantic county,
    Quebec, erected in 1802. It took its name from the
    English town.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Lennox</span>: county in Ontario, organized in 1792.</p>
<p>It took its name from Charles Lennox, third Duke of
    Richmond, 1734-1806, active in the political affairs of
    his day. On April 7, 1778, the Earl of Chatham, broken
    in health, was assisted to the House of Lords to protest
    against the dismemberment of the monarchy. &ldquo;He listened
    impatiently to the reply of the Duke of Richmond
    (in favour of the surrender of the thirteen American colonies),
    and again rose to speak. But he had hardly
    risen when he pressed his hand upon his heart, and
    falling back in a swoon, was borne home to die.&rdquo;&mdash;John
    Richard Green.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Lennoxville</span>: town in Sherbrooke county, Quebec.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Charles Gordon Lennox,
    fourth Duke of Richmond, Governor-General of Canada,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span> 1818-1819. He died suddenly of the worst form of hydrophobia,
    having been bitten by a tamed fox.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Lethbridge</span>: city in southern Alberta, founded in 1885.</p>
<p>It was named after William Lethbridge, 1824-1901,
    formerly of London, England, and first president of the
    North Western Coal and Navigation Co., Ltd.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Levis</span>: city in the county of Levis, Quebec.</p>
<p>Both were named in honour of Francis Gaston,
    Chevalier de Levis, 1719-1787, who was in command at
    Montreal when Quebec fell in 1759. On Montcalm&rsquo;s
    death, Levis assumed command of the French forces in
    Canada. In an effort to retake Quebec, he won the battle
    of Sainte Foye in the spring of 1760. According to
    Kingsford, Levis possessed ability and courage, but was
    lacking in personal honour.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Lillooet</span>: district, town, lake, and river in British
    Columbia.</p>
<p>Lillooet is an Indian word meaning &ldquo;wild onion&rdquo;. The
    Report of the Geographic Board of Canada states that
    Lake Lillooet is so indicated on A. C. Anderson&rsquo;s MS. map
    of 1849.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Limerick</span>: township in Hastings county, Ontario,
    surveyed in 1857.</p>
<p>It took its name from the city of Limerick in the
    county of Limerick, Ireland. Limerick is embalmed in
    literature as the city of the Fights. The Danes over-powered
    the Irish here and built a fortress about the
    middle of the ninth century. In 1651 it fought bravely
    against the Parliamentary army under the command of
    Ireton. Limerick fought desperately against the army of
    King William III., and was the last place in Ireland to
    submit to his sovereignty.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Lincoln</span>: county in Ontario, organized in 1792.</p>
<p>It took its name from Lincolnshire, England. This
    English county contained several Roman roads, and
    military stations. The city of Lincoln, municipal centre
    of the shire, was a hill-fort of the ancient Britons. Its
    ancient cathedral still retains some of its former
    splendour.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Lindsay</span>: township in the county of Bruce, Ontario,
    surveyed in 1855.</p>
<p>Lord Bury, the son of the Earl of Albemarle, visited
    Canada in 1855 and it is said that he had the honour of
    naming this township after his mother&rsquo;s people, the
    Lindsays.</p>
<p>Lindsay is also the name of the county-town of
    Victoria county, Ontario. The original survey of this site
    was made in 1825 by John Huston of Cavan, who had as
    an assistant a man named Lindsay. He died following an
    accidental shooting, and the circumstances of his death
    led to the town-site being called Lindsay. Information
    received from Mr. A. F. Palen, Postmaster.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Lion&rsquo;s Head</span>: village on Georgian Bay in Grey county,
    Ontario, incorporated in 1917. The post office was opened
    in 1875 with F. W. Stewart as Postmaster.</p>
<p>The village took its name from the resemblance to
    a lion&rsquo;s head to be seen on a rocky cliff about two miles
    out in the Georgian Bay, which point was so called by the
    Indians and by the first surveyors&mdash;Point Hangcliff or
    Lion&rsquo;s Head.</p>
<p><span class="bold">L&rsquo;Islet</span>; (le-lá): county in the province of Quebec.
    This county is composed of two old seigneuries, L&rsquo;Islet
    and Bonsecours, united under the name of L&rsquo;Islet.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>
<p>The original islet was surrounded by the waters of
    rivers, hence the name.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Lister</span>: township in Nipissing district Ontario,
    erected in 1884.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of James Frederick Lister, a
    member of the legal profession, Sarnia, Ontario. He
    represented West Lambton in the House of Commons,
    1882-&rsquo;98, and was later a judge of the Court of Appeal.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Listowel</span>: town in Perth county, Ontario.</p>
<p>It took its name from Listowel in Kerry county,
    Ireland, a pleasant, picturesque and prosperous town.</p>
<p>The name Listowel is derived from lis, liss (Irish <i>lios</i>) meaning &ldquo;a fort&rdquo; and the personal name Tuathal or
    Thoohal, that is Tuathal&rsquo;s or Thoohal&rsquo;s fort.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Liverpool</span>: town and harbour in Queen&rsquo;s county, Nova
    Scotia. They are named after Liverpool, England.</p>
<p>There is a fanciful story that it took its name from a
    large extinct bird, called the liver, which used to frequent
    that part of the Mersey river on which the city is situated.
    Johnston in his <i>Place Names of England and Wales</i> says
    this supposed origin is wholly imaginative. He states
    that it is probably derived from Old English <i>laefer</i> or <i>liber</i> meaning &ldquo;a rush-like or sword-like plant&rdquo;, and the
    word pool, a place in the river where these plants grew in
    abundance.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Livingstone</span>: township in Haliburton district, Ontario,
    organized in 1877.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of David Livingstone, missionary
    and explorer, born at Blantyre, Scotland, March
    19, 1813, died at Llala, Africa, May 1, 1873. The London
    Missionary Society sent him to South Africa in 1840,
    where he spent the rest of his life in the interests of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span> natives and their country. He discovered Lakes Nyassa,
    Rangweolo, Moero, and also the sources of the Congo
    River. At one period no communications were received
    from him for three years. It was then that the <i>New York
    Herald</i> sent its correspondent, Henry M. Stanley, in
    search of Livingstone. Stanley found him busily engaged
    in his beloved work near Lake Tanganyika. The two
    travellers parted in 1872 and Livingstone died the next
    year. His body was brought home in 1874 and buried in
    Westminster Abbey.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Lloydminster</span>: prosperous village on the Alberta-Saskatchewan
    boundary. This district was at first the
    site of an all-British colony founded by Rev. I. M. Barr
    but soon taken over by its chaplain, Rev. George Exton
    Lloyd, after whom the town is named. The colony is no
    longer composed of people of all-British birth. Americans,
    Canadians and Scandinavians have flocked into this
    fertile area.</p>
<p>At the battle of Cut Knife Hill in 1885, two
    theological students from Toronto, Lloyd and Atcheson,
    distinguished themselves for resource and bravery under
    the deadly fire of Poundmaker&rsquo;s braves. It is that same
    Lloyd whose name is immortalized in the town of Lloydminster
    and who is now Bishop of Saskatchewan.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Lobo</span>: township in Middlesex county, Ontario, erected
    in 1821.</p>
<p>The word is Spanish meaning &ldquo;wolf&rdquo;. The name was,
    doubtless, given by Sir Peregrine Maitland, Lieutenant-Governor
    of Upper Canada, 1818-&rsquo;28, who had a fancy
    for Spanish names, having served under Wellington in
    the Peninsular War.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Lochiel</span>: township in Glengarry county, Ontario,
    formed in 1816.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>
<p>It took its name from Lochiel, chief of the Clan
    Cameron. Thomas Campbell has embalmed the name in
    his poem, &ldquo;Lochiel&rsquo;s Warning&rdquo;. This chief fell at
    Culloden, fighting valiantly for the cause of Charles
    Edward Stuart, &ldquo;Bonnie Prince Charlie&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Logan</span>: township in Perth county, Ontario, surveyed
    in 1830.</p>
<p>It was named after Hart Logan, merchant of London,
    England, and a director of the Canada Land Company.
    His nephew Sir William E. Logan was a learned Canadian
    geologist.</p>
<p><span class="bold">London</span>: city, Ontario, county-town of Middlesex
    county; also the name of a township in this county,
    erected in 1798.</p>
<p>They took their name from the capital city of the
    British Empire. The early Britons called this place, then
    a hamlet constructed of wicker and mud, Llyndin, meaning
    the &ldquo;town on the lake&rdquo;. The Romans renamed it
    Augustus, after their Emperor Augustus, that is &ldquo;the
    venerated one&rdquo;, but the Saxon conquerors retained the
    British name Lindum, now spelled London.</p>
<p>The site of the Canadian city of London was examined
    by Lieutenant-Governor Simcoe, accompanied by Captain
    Fitzgerald, Lieutenants Smith, Talbot, Grey and Givins,
    and his secretary, Major Littlehales, in 1793. It was
    judged to be &ldquo;a situation eminently calculated for the
    metropolis of all Canada&rdquo;. Simcoe selected York as the
    site of an excellent port of entry and a safer seat for his
    government than Newark. His intuition was that the
    future capital should be inland at the forks of the Thames
    and should be named Georgina, in compliment to
    George III.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Longford</span>: township in Victoria county, Ontario,
    organized in 1858.</p>
<p>It took its name from the county of Longford in
    Ireland. The earldom of Longford belongs to the Pakenham
    family. The first Duke of Wellington married a
    daughter of the Earl of Longford of the period.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Longueuil</span>: township in Prescott county, Ontario,
    formed in 1798.</p>
<p>The word is derived from the French, <i>long-ue</i> and <i>oeil</i>, an eye, meaning &ldquo;long eye&rdquo; or &ldquo;long view&rdquo;. Charles
    Le Moyne acquired a seigniory in Chambly county,
    Quebec, in 1672, which possessed a fine, long view of the
    St. Lawrence River. He added de Longueuil to his name
    and received letters patent for the title from his sovereign.
    New Longueuil in the county of Soulanges,
    Quebec, was granted to Sieur Joseph Lemoine in 1734.</p>
<p><span class="bold">L&rsquo;Orignal</span>: picturesque and historic village in Prescott
    county, Ontario. It is the county-town of the united
    counties of Prescott and Russell. In 1873 the place was
    incorporated as a village by special Act of the Province.
    Its history dates from 1797, when Nathan Hayard
    Treadwell erected a mill here.</p>
<p>The village took its name from L&rsquo;Orignal Point which
    extends into the Ottawa River a short distance from the
    place. The word L&rsquo;Orignal is French and means &ldquo;the
    elk&rdquo;, a species of deer. It is said &ldquo;the Point&rdquo; was
    a crossing-place for deer, which was remarked by the
    voyageurs in passing up and down the river, hence the
    name.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Lotbinière</span>: county in Quebec, south shore of St.
    Lawrence River.</p>
<p>It took its name from Louis Théandre Chartier de
    Lotbinière who served his country well for many years in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span> councils and courts. Intendant Talon granted him a
    seigniory on the St. Lawrence on November 3, 1672.
    Lotbinière gave his own name to his possessions.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Loughborough</span>: township, Frontenac county, Ontario,
    formed in 1798.</p>
<p>It took its name from Alexander Wedderburn, Baron
    Loughborough, Earl of Rosslyn, 1733-1805. He was an
    able lawyer and was made Attorney-General in 1780.
    Mitcham Grove, Surrey, a beautiful country home, was
    presented to Loughborough by Lord Clive for his masterly
    defence of him in his trial in the House of Commons. But
    withal, history records he was lacking in personal honour.
    It is said that when King George III. heard he was dead,
    he remarked: &ldquo;He has not left a greater knave behind
    him in my dominions.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="bold">Louisbourg</span>: town on the south-east coast of Cape
    Breton, Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>The French built a fortress here in 1713 and named
    it Louisbourg in honour of Louis XIV., 1638-1715, King of
    France. General Amherst&rsquo;s forces captured the fortress
    in 1758 and completely destroyed it and the town. When
    the writer visited the site in 1915, only a few relics of the
    bomb-proof casemates of the King&rsquo;s bastion remained.
    Over the grass-grown ground, where formerly stood a
    great fortress and a busy town, a flock of sheep was
    quietly grazing. A granite shaft on the site of the Dauphin&rsquo;s
    Gate of the fort, erected by citizens of the U.S.,
    the Society of Colonial Wars in America, in 1895, commemorates
    the first capture of Louisbourg by Sir William
    Pepperell and Commodore Peter Warren in 1745. This
    monument was later handed over to the care of Canada&rsquo;s
    Department of the Interior.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>
<p>The modern town, generally spelled Louisburg, is on
    the opposite side of the harbour, on the ground on which
    Wolfe erected his battery in the siege of 1758. It is made
    up largely of fishermen and coal-miners. But the scene is
    not altogether one of desolation. Between the new and
    the old town stands a powerful Marconi wireless transmitting
    station.</p>
<p>In 1928 Canada acquired 328 acres of land surrounding
    and including the remains of the famous French
    fortification and it is to be marked and preserved as a
    national monument by the National Parks Branch of the
    Dominion Government.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Louise</span>: canton in Frontenac county, Quebec, erected
    in 1920, and also a far-famed Alpine lake in Alberta.</p>
<p>Both were named in honour of the Princess Louise,
    daughter of Queen Victoria, and wife of the Marquis of
    Lorne, Governor-General of Canada, 1878-&rsquo;83.</p>
<p>A correspondent of <i>The Globe</i> writes:</p>
<div class="blockquot">
    <p>&ldquo;I have a picture taken from <i>Punch</i> just after the marriage

<p><span class="bold">Lount</span>: township, Parry Sound district, Ontario, was
    surveyed in 1874.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>
<p>It took its name from William Lount, Q.C., of Toronto.
    He was M.P.P. for North Simcoe, 1867-&rsquo;71. Mr. Lount
    was a son of George Lount, Esquire, Registrar of Simcoe
    county, and nephew of Samuel Lount who was hanged in
    Toronto in 1838 for his part in the Rebellion of 1837, in
    Upper Canada.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Louth</span>: township in Lincoln county, Ontario, erected
    in 1792.</p>
<p>It took its name from the town of Louth, Lincolnshire,
    England.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Lucan</span>: enterprising town in Middlesex county,
    Ontario.</p>
<p>There is a township named Lucan in Cheshire and also
    in Lancashire, England, and a village by this name in
    Dublin county, Ireland. Dr. Joyce, an Irish authority,
    states <i>lucan</i> means &ldquo;land producing marsh mallows&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The Earl of Lucan was in command of the cavalry at
    Balaclava. It fell to him to carry out the order which
    resulted in the famous &ldquo;Charge of the Light Brigade&rdquo;.
    Blamed by Lord Raglan, commander of the British forces,
    who was his brother-in-law, Lucan was recalled, but not
    generally held to blame.</p>
<p>Lord Raglan, smarting under the criticism at home,
    fell sick and died in camp, 1855.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Lulu</span>: an island at the mouth of the Fraser River, B.C.
    It is the centre of Japanese salmon canneries.</p>
<p>This island was so named in 1862 by Colonel Moody,
    R.E., in command of the Royal Engineers, in honour of
    Lulu Sweet, an actress in the first troupe that visited New
    Westminster. Miss Sweet was much admired for her
    acting, good manners and graceful bearing.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Lunenburg</span>: county in Nova Scotia. It was settled
    in 1751 by immigrants from Hanover, and retains to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span> certain extent its German character. The movement was
    under the fostering care of George II., who was King of
    Hanover as well as of Great Britain and Ireland.</p>
<p>The name is derived from Luneburg (properly
    spelled) in Hanover, the old home of the pioneers of this
    county.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Luther</span>: (East): township in Dufferin county, and
    Luther (West) a township in Wellington county, Ontario,
    both surveyed in 1821.</p>
<p>It was named after Martin Luther, the eminent religious
    reformer, born at Eisleben, Germany, Nov. 10,
    1483; died there Feb. 18, 1546. He completed the translation
    of the Bible into German in 1534. In his sermons
    and theses, he denied the Pope all right to forgive sins,
    and maintained that papal absolution had no value.</p>
<p>H. F. Gardiner in his book, <i>Nothing But Words</i>,
    states: &ldquo;A correspondent gives the following account of
    the naming of Luther and Melancthon townships, which
    he had from a man who assisted to survey them. He
    said the surveyor first ran lines round these townships
    and filled the interior with the legend &lsquo;All Swamp&rsquo;.
    The plans were sent back and he was ordered to survey
    the townships into farm lots. Having done so, he said
    that as it was the meanest tract of land he had ever surveyed
    he would name the country after the meanest men
    he had ever heard of, so being a Roman Catholic, he called
    the one township Luther and the other Melancthon township.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="bold">Lutterworth</span>: township in Haliburton district,
    Ontario, erected in 1858.</p>
<p>It took its name from Lutterworth, a town on the
    Swift River in Leicestershire, England. Lutterworth
    was the residence of John Wycliffe, born in Yorkshire,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span> England, about 1324; died Dec. 13, 1384. He was
    educated at Oxford University and became Master of
    Baliol College, later rector of the parish of Lutterworth.
    Wycliffe translated the Bible into English from the Latin
    Vulgate, and challenged several of the doctrines of the
    Roman Catholic Church. The Council of Constance in
    1414 pronounced him a heretic, and his bones were dug
    up and burnt, the ashes being thrown into the River
    Swift. He is now regarded as a forerunner of the Reformation.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Lyell</span>: township in Nipissing district, Ontario,
    formed in 1872.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Sir Charles Lyell, a
    distinguished English geologist, 1797-1895. He visited
    Niagara and was the first to compute the number of years
    it had taken the Falls to recede from the high land at
    Queenston, 35,000 years at one foot a year.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Lyn</span>: picturesque village in Leeds county, Ontario.</p>
<p>Its first name was Coleman&rsquo;s Corners, after its
    founder, an Englishman, Abel Coleman, 1764-1810. In
    the third quarter of the nineteenth century the village
    became a flourishing centre of industry and a more
    serviceable name was sought. A crystal stream of water
    afforded the power to drive the wheels of its mills and
    suggested Lyn. The word is derived from the Scotch <i>lyne</i>, Welsh <i>llyn</i>, meaning &ldquo;a pool, stream, cascade&rdquo;.
    Lynn, Mass., is English in origin, derived from the linden
    or lime tree.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Lyndhurst</span>: thriving and historic village in Leeds
    county, Ontario.</p>
<p>One-half mile south of this village was erected the
    first smelter in Upper Canada about the year 1800. Because
    of this and the mining activities in the vicinity, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span> place was formerly called Furnace Falls. By 1850 there
    had been erected a carding and fulling mill, a saw mill,
    grist mill, post office, and one small tavern. At this time
    Okill Jones had secured all the water privileges on the
    local stream whose outlet is the Gananoque River and he
    had the name changed to Lyndhurst by the Postmaster-General
    in honour of John Singleton Copely, Baron
    Lyndhurst (1772-1863).</p>
<p>Lyndhurst&rsquo;s parents were U.E. Loyalists who left
    Boston for London on the outbreak of the War of Independence,
    1775. Young Copely&rsquo;s father sent him to
    Trinity College, Cambridge, where he took a brilliant
    course, graduating in 1794, being second in the mathematical
    tripos and first in his own college. He chose the
    profession of law and after a distinguished record at the
    bar, he entered parliament and rose to be Lord Chancellor.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Lyndoch</span>: township in Renfrew county, Ontario,
    organized in 1862.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Thomas Graham, Baron
    Lyndoch, 1750-1843, a distinguished military officer under
    Wellington. He was in command of the forces that
    besieged Malta, 1798-1800, until the French surrendered
    the fortress. For his services during the Peninsular
    War he was made a general and a peer with a pension of
    £2000 a year.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Macaulay</span>: township in Muskoka district, Ontario,
    erected in 1857.</p>
<p>It was named after Chief-Justice Sir James Buchanan
    Macaulay, 1793-1859. He was a son of Dr. James
    Macaulay, of the 33rd Foot, was born at Niagara, studied
    law, and was called to the bar in 1822. In the war of 1812,
    Macaulay shared the dangers and duties of the field with
    the Glengarry Fencibles.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Machar</span>: township in Parry Sound district, Ontario,
    formed in 1875.</p>
<p>It was named by Sir Oliver Mowat, when Premier of
    Ontario, in memory of Rev. John Machar, D.D., formerly
    minister of St. Andrew&rsquo;s Church, Kingston. He was one
    of the founders of Queen&rsquo;s University, and for ten years
    its president.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Machedash</span>: township in Simcoe county, Ontario,
    surveyed in 1822.</p>
<p>Machedash is an Indian word meaning &ldquo;marshy land&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Mackenzie</span>: river and district in north-western
    Canada.</p>
<p>They were named in honour of Sir Alexander
    Mackenzie, (1755-1820), explorer. In 1789 he discovered
    the Mackenzie River, and was the first white man to
    reach the Pacific overland from Canada, 1793.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Mackenzie</span>: township, Parry Sound district, formed
    in 1872; mount, Kootenay district, B.C.</p>
<p>They were named in honour of Hon. Alexander
    Mackenzie, born in Dundalk, Scotland, in 1822, died in
    Toronto, 1892. He worked at his trade of stone-mason in
    Kingston and Sarnia, and represented Lambton in the
    Canadian Assembly, 1861-&rsquo;67. After Confederation Mr.
    Mackenzie became a member of the House of Commons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span> representing Lambton and later East York until his
    death. When the Liberal Party came into power he was
    chosen Prime Minister of Canada, 1873-&rsquo;78. Mr.
    Mackenzie was offered knighthood by the Queen in 1877
    but declined the honour.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Mackinac</span>: strait connecting Lake Huron with Lake
    Michigan, also island situated in Lake Michigan and Lake
    Huron.</p>
<p>The word Mackinac is Algonquin Indian and means
    &ldquo;tortoise&rdquo; or &ldquo;turtle&rdquo;. Alexander Henry in his notes of
    the island in his Voyage of 1760 states the name is very
    appropriate, the physical appearance of the centre of the
    island resembling a turtle. The name passed from the
    island to the strait adjacent. Michilimackinac was the
    former name of the island, <i>michi</i> meaning grand, &ldquo;the
    grand turtle&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In the county of Champlain, Quebec, there are a lake
    and a village bearing the same name (Algonquin) but
    written Mickinack. In this instance the name was first
    applied to the water, turtle lake.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Macleod</span>: town on the C.P.R. about one hundred miles
    south of Calgary, Alberta.</p>
<p>In 1874 Col. J. F. Macleod, Commissioner of the North
    West Mounted Police, (merged into the Royal Canadian
    Mounted Police, in 1920) selected the site of this town on
    which to erect a fort and barracks for his men serving
    as police in that district. The establishment was named
    Fort Macleod in the leader&rsquo;s honour. With settlement and
    civil government, the place became known simply as
    Macleod.</p>
<p>In 1880 Col. Macleod resigned his position as Commissioner.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Madawaska</span>: river, tributary of the Ottawa River,
    Renfrew county, Ontario.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>
<p>The word is Indian but its meaning is disputed. The
    Geographic Board of Canada gives &ldquo;having its outlet
    among reeds&rdquo;. Roy gives &ldquo;land of the porcupine&rdquo;.
    Madawaska is also the name of a county in New Brunswick
    and of a river rising in Lake Temiscouta and
    emptying into the St. John River at Edmunston, N.B.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Madoc</span>: town and also a township in Hastings county,
    Ontario, organized in 1820.</p>
<p>It took its name from Madoc, a Welsh prince. He is
    said by the early chroniclers of this country to have
    discovered the new world beyond the western seas, now
    America, in 1170. Madoc made a second voyage from
    which he never returned.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Maganatawan</span>: river and town in Parry Sound district,
    Ontario.</p>
<p>The term is Indian and means &ldquo;a long channel&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Maidstone</span>: township in Essex county, Ontario,
    surveyed in 1792.</p>
<p>It took its name from Maidstone, county-town of Kent,
    England. Mr. William Woollet who engraved the plate of
    the historical picture, &ldquo;The Death of Wolfe&rdquo;, was born at
    Maidstone.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Maitland</span>: village in Grenville county, Ontario, situated
    on the River St. Lawrence, and river in western
    Ontario, emptying into Lake Huron at the town of
    Goderich.</p>
<p>They were named after Sir Peregrine Maitland,
    Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada from 1818-1828.
    During his term of office Sir Peregrine became very
    unpopular with a large section of the population. He was
    ruled by the sinister Family Compact.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Malagash</span>: town and point, northern shore of Nova
    Scotia.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>
<p>The origin of the name is uncertain. Some writers
    derive it from the Indian word, <i>Malegawate</i>, meaning,
    &ldquo;the mocking place&rdquo;, the annual games of the young
    braves of the district having been held there. Micmac
    scholars say the word means &ldquo;the end of smooth water&rdquo;,
    being rough beyond the point. Other authorities derive
    Malagash from <i>meligech</i> the Indian word for &ldquo;milk&rdquo;,
    referring to the milky surf prevalent in a storm.</p>
<p>A salt mine has recently been uncovered at Malagash.
    It is part of the deposit of what was once a salt lake
    here, the water of which was subsequently evaporated.
    The quantity of salt in that particular region is estimated
    as over 60,000 tons.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Malahide</span>: township in Elgin county, Ontario, organized
    in 1810.</p>
<p>It was named after Malahide, a town near Dublin,
    Ireland. It was there that Colonel Thomas Talbot, in
    pioneer days the sovereign, <i>de facto</i>, if not <i>de jure</i>, of a
    vast tract of wild land along the shore of Lake Erie, was
    born, and, doubtless, the name was suggested by him.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Malden</span>: township in Essex county, Ontario, erected in
    1792.</p>
<p>It took its name from the town of Malden in Essex,
    England. On the field of Malden in 991 the Norwegian
    Vikings utterly defeated the host of East Anglia under
    Ethelred the Unready.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Mallorytown</span>: thriving village on the C.N.R. in Leeds
    county, Ontario.</p>
<p>The place is named after the Mallory family. The
    pioneers were Daniel Mallory and his wife, United
    Empire Loyalists, who came here from Vermont in 1784.
    Their great grandsons still occupy the lands on which
    their ancestors settled.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Manitoba</span>: province of Canada, erected May 12th, 1870,
    and a lake in the same province.</p>
<p>This euphonious name was originally applied to the
    lake only, or according to some authorities to the narrows
    of the lake only. Two explanations of this Indian word
    are given. One derives it from the Cree <i>manito-wapow</i> or the Objibway <i>manito-baw</i>, meaning &ldquo;the strait of the
    manito or spirit&rdquo;. On stormy days a roaring sound is
    produced by the waves dashing pebbles against the rocky
    beach of an island (Manitoba) in the strait, and this gave
    rise to the Indian superstition.</p>
<p>The other explanation derives the word from the
    Assiniboine or Sioux, mine, meaning &ldquo;water&rdquo;, and <i>toba</i>,
    meaning &ldquo;prairie&rdquo;; &ldquo;the water or lake of the prairie&rdquo;.
    The La Vérendryes, father and son, discovered this lake
    in 1738, and in their journal call it Lac des Prairies, or
    Lake of the Prairies. At that time the Assiniboine
    Indians dwelt on its shores.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Manitoulin</span>: large island in Lake Huron, province of
    Ontario.</p>
<p>The word is Algonquin Indian, meaning the home of
    the spirit. According to their superstitions it was the
    abode of both the good spirit, gitchi-manito, and of the
    evil spirit, matchi-manito.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Manvers</span>: township in Durham county, Ontario,
    erected in 1816.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Charles Pierrepont,
    1737-1816, Earl Manvers. This British title has been
    borne by the Pierrepont family since 1806. Their home
    seat is in Nottinghamshire. Members of the family are
    prominent still in affairs of state.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Mara</span>: township in Ontario county, Ontario, surveyed
    in 1820.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>
<p>It was, doubtless, named after Madam Mara, a favourite
    public singer in England at that time.</p>
<p><span class="bold">March</span>: township in Carleton country, Ontario,
    organized in 1823.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of the Duke of Richmond, Earl
    of March. The name is derived from the French word, <i>marche</i> meaning &ldquo;a mark, a frontier boundary&rdquo;. Soon
    after the Norman conquest, districts on the border of
    Wales and Scotland began to be known as marches.
    These lands were granted to powerful nobles on condition
    they protected the bordering counties of England. In
    Edward I.&rsquo;s reign one-half the area of Wales was known
    as the Marches of Wales. The marches were only of
    historical importance by the reign of Elizabeth.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Maria</span>: township in Renfrew county, Ontario, erected
    in 1859.</p>
<p>It is said to have been named in honour of Anna Maria
    Yorke, wife of Sir Edmund Walker Head, Governor-General
    of Canada from 1854 to 1860.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Mariposa</span>: township, Victoria county, Ontario, surveyed
    in 1821. It is also the name of a village in the
    township.</p>
<p>The word is Spanish, and signifies &ldquo;butterfly&rdquo;. It
    was, no doubt, given by Sir Peregrine Maitland, Lieutenant-Governor
    of Upper Canada, 1818-&rsquo;28. He had rendered
    military service in Spain before coming to Canada.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Markham</span>: township in York county, Ontario, organized
    in 1792.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of the Most Reverend
    William Markham, D.D., 1720-1806. He became Bishop
    of Chester in 1771, and Archbishop of York in 1777.
    Henceforth he was active and influential in both church
    and state.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>
<p>The town of Markham in this township was also
    named after the archbishop.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Marlborough</span>: township in Carleton county, Ontario,
    formed in 1798.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of John Churchill, Duke of
    Marlborough, 1650-1722, the greatest general England
    had before Wellington. For his services in the War of the
    Spanish Succession, Queen Anne showered honours upon
    him. Later he was accused of having misused public
    money and removed from his command. However, at
    his death he was buried with great pomp in Westminster
    Abbey. The title was taken from the town of Marlborough
    in Wiltshire, England. It is situated at the foot
    of a hill of marl, hence the name.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Marmora</span>: town and township in Hastings county,
    Ontario, surveyed in 1820.</p>
<p>Singular <i>marmor</i>, plural <i>marmora</i>, is the Latin word
    for marble. There are marble quarries in this township,
    hence the name.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Marquette</span>: county in Manitoba.</p>
<p>It commemorates Père Jacques Marquette (1637-&rsquo;75),
    a distinguished French missionary of the Jesuit order to
    the Indians of Canada. He founded missions at Sault Ste.
    Marie and Mackinaw.</p>
<p>In 1673, Talon, Intendant of New France, commissioned
    Marquette and Joliet, a geographer of Quebec
    city, to seek the great river flowing south of which the
    Indians had told him. They went by way of Lake
    Michigan, Green Bay, Fox River, Wisconsin River, until
    they beheld the Mississippi, as Marquette wrote, &ldquo;with a
    joy I cannot express&rdquo;. They descended the great river to
    the mouth of the Arkansas, where they turned back on
    account of the hostility of the Indians and Spaniards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span> beyond this point. It remained to the heroic La Salle to
    explore &ldquo;the Father of Waters&rdquo; to its mouth, 1682.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Maryborough</span>: township in Wellington county,
    Ontario, erected in 1840.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Marysburg</span>: township in Prince Edward county,
    Ontario, formed in 1786.</p>
<p>It was named after Princess Mary, daughter of King
    George III. She is said to have been one of the good
    Maries of history.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Maskinonge</span>: county in Quebec.</p>
<p>The word is Algonquin Indian, derived from <i>mac</i> or <i>mask</i>, meaning &ldquo;large&rdquo;, and <i>kinonge</i> meaning &ldquo;pike&rdquo;.
    The maskinonge is the largest fish found in fresh water.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Master</span>: township in Nipissing district, Ontario,
    erected in 1892.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Isaac Master, M.P.P. for
    South Waterloo at that time.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Matane</span>: canton, erected in 1834, lakes and river in
    the county of Matane, Quebec.</p>
<p>The word is said to be a corruption of Micmac Indian <i>mtctan</i> meaning &ldquo;beaver ponds&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Matapedia</span>: town, lake, and river, eastern Quebec.</p>
<p>The word is Micmac, meaning &ldquo;a volume of water
    which descends into a great sea&rdquo;. Rand derives it from
    Micmac <i>madabegeak</i>, meaning &ldquo;roughly flowing waters&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Matchedash</span>: bay, an arm of Georgian bay, Ontario.</p>
<p>The word is Indian and signifies, &ldquo;a bad and swampy

<p><span class="bold">Matheson</span>: town on the Temiscaming and Northern
    Ontario Railway.</p>
<p>It was named after Lieut.-Col. the Hon. Arthur James
    Matheson of Perth, Ontario. He represented South

    1905 Mr. Matheson became Provincial Treasurer in the
    Whitney administration. He was a lawyer by profession.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Matilda</span>: township in Dundas county, Ontario, organized
    in 1787.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of the Princess Royal,
    Charlotte Augusta Matilda, 1766-1828, daughter of King
    George III. She married Frederick, King of Wurtemburg,
    in 1797. It was with great regret that the Princess
    quitted her English home.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Mattagami</span>: river and lake in Sudbury and Timiskaming
    districts, Ontario, and also a lake in Abitibi territory,
    Quebec.</p>
<p>It is an Indian word signifying &ldquo;where the waters
    meet&rdquo;, according to the Geographic Board of Canada.
    R. P. Lemoine derives the term from Montagnais Indian <i>mitta gumaii</i>, meaning &ldquo;a lake where one may find wood

    Maurice, Quebec.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Mattawatchan</span>: township in Renfrew county, Ontario,
    surveyed in 1859.</p>
<p>The meaning of this Indian term is disputed. Some
    think it might be another form of the word <span class="bold">Madawaska</span>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span> the name of a larger river flowing through the township.
    Mr. William White thinks it may be derived from Mattawa
    or Mattawan. Dr. Jones states Mattawan means
    &ldquo;greasy&rdquo; and that Mattawatchan refers to something
    greasy, but he does not offer any explanation of the
    connection.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Maxville</span>: enterprising village on C.N.R. in the north-western
    part of Glengarry county, Ontario. Its growth
    dates from 1880.</p>
<p>The district was settled by immigrants from Scotland.

    named Macsville, corrupted into Maxville.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Mayo</span>: township, Hastings county, Ontario, organized
    in 1857.</p>
<p>It took its name from the county of Mayo, Free State,

<p>It was named in honour of Sir Francis Leopold
    McClintock, 1819-1907, the gallant Arctic navigator.
    In 1857 he discovered the fate of Sir John Franklin, his
    two ships, the <i>Erebus</i> and <i>Terror</i> and their crews.
    Lady Franklin had fitted out the yatch <i>Fox</i> for this
    expedition and McClintock in 1860 told the stirring story
    in <i>The Voyage of the Fox in the Arctic Seas</i>. He received
    many promotions for his naval services, reaching the
    highest rank, full admiral, in 1884.</p>
<p><span class="bold">McClure</span>: strait between Banks Island and Melville
    Island, Franklin territory, and also a township in
    Hastings county, Ontario, erected in 1857.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>
<p>Both are named in honour of Sir Robert J. McClure,
    Arctic explorer, 1807-&rsquo;73. Some authorities credit him
    with the discovery of the Northwest Passage (that is a
    water-way from the Atlantic to the mouth the Great Fish
    River), in 1850, but this honour really belongs to Sir
    John Franklin&rsquo;s crew, who perished there in 1848.
    However, McClure discovered two straits on either side of
    Banks Island.</p>
<p><span class="bold">McConkey</span>: township in Parry Sound district, Ontario,

    Governors-General, was built by Mr. McKay for a private
    residence. He voted for the secularization of the Clergy
    Reserve Lands.</p>
<p><span class="bold">McKellar</span>: township in Parry Sound district, Ontario,
    surveyed in 1869.</p>
<p>It was named after Hon. Archibald McKellar, 1816-&rsquo;94,
    M.P. for Kent county of the Canadian Assembly, 1857-&rsquo;67
    and M.P.P. for Bothwell, 1867-&rsquo;75. Mr. McKellar was

<p><span class="bold">McLean</span>: township in Muskoka district, Ontario,
    formed in 1862.</p>
<p>It was named for Archibald McLean, 1791-1865. He
    was a lawyer by profession and appointed to the Bench in
    1837. In 1860 a fugitive slave had escaped from Missouri
    to Canada and in doing so had killed a man who tried to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span> prevent his escape. His extradition was demanded under
    the Ashburton Treaty. A Court of Appeal, consisting of
    Chief-Justice Robinson, Justice Burns, and Judge
    McLean, was appointed to report on the case. The court
    decided that Anderson should be given up, McLean
    dissenting. Later the former slave was set free by the
    Court of Common Pleas at Toronto on the ground of
    informality in his warrant of committal. No further
    action was taken against Anderson.</p>
<p><span class="bold">McMurrich</span>: township in Parry Sound district,
    Ontario, surveyed in 1870.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Hon. John McMurrich,
    1804-&rsquo;83, a wholesale merchant of Toronto. He was

    in 1825.</p>
<p>It took its name from Archibald McNab, 1775-1860,
    the last of the Chiefs of the McNab clan. He came from
    Scotland to Canada with some of his clan in 1825 and
    settled on the banks of the Ottawa River. Chief McNab
    tried to form a colony there on the fashion of the feudal
    system but it was not satisfactory to the settlers. In
    1842 the Government of Canada took over the project and
    paid McNab $16,000 for his interests.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Meaford</span>: town in Grey county, Ontario. It was part
    of the township of St. Vincent until 1874 when it was
    incorporated into a town.</p>
<p>The town took its name from Meaford Hall, Staffordshire,
    England, the country seat of Admiral Sir John
    Jarvis, Earl St. Vincent, who was Nelson&rsquo;s superior
    officer in the battle of Cape St. Vincent. All the streets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span> in the original plot of the town are named after British
    naval officers.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Medicine Hat</span>: city in Alberta.</p>
<p>The Indian name is Saamis, meaning the headdress of
    a medicine man. The site was selected in 1882 by
    W. Johnson of the Royal North West Mounted Police.
    The origin of the name is disputed. One explanation
    states that in a fight between the Cree and Blackfoot
    tribes in this district, the Cree medicine man lost his
    professional hat in the river and the battle was, therefore,
    lost by his people; another story connects the name with
    the rescue of a squaw by a brave from the South
    Saskatchewan River here and of his reward, a medicine
    hat from his admirers; another account states that the
    name was first applied to a hill east of the town, from its
    resemblance to an Indian medicine man&rsquo;s hat.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Medonte</span>: township in Simcoe county, Ontario, surveyed
    in 1822.</p>
<p>It is an Indian word but its meaning is uncertain.
    Dr. Jones translates it by &ldquo;Evil Spirit&rdquo;. The late John
    Reade, for many years a writer on the Montreal <i>Gazette</i>,
    thought Medonte might be a corruption of the Objibway
    word <i>madonan</i>, meaning &ldquo;I carry on my back&rdquo;, referring
    to an Indian portage between Orillia and Matchedash
    Bay.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Medora</span>: township in Muskoka district, Ontario,
    formed in 1869.</p>
<p>It took its name from Medora Cameron, wife of Mr.
    A. Cameron of Toronto, and niece of Hon. Stephen
    Richards, Commissioner of Crown Lands for Ontario,
    1867-&rsquo;71. Byron has embalmed &ldquo;Medora&rdquo; in his tale,
    &ldquo;The Corsair&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Megantic</span>: county in Quebec, and also a lake and
    village in Frontenac county, Quebec province.</p>
<p>Some writers derive Megantic from an Abenaki
    Indian word meaning &ldquo;the place where they catch fish&rdquo;,
    and others from the Cree word <i>miatick</i>, meaning &ldquo;great
    forest&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Melancthon</span>: township in Dufferin county, Ontario,
    organized in 1821.</p>
<p>It was named in memory of Philip Melanchthon,
    1497-1560, the brilliant scholar of the Lutheran Reformation.
    The Elector of Saxony appointed him Professor
    of Greek at the University of Wittenberg in 1518. He
    published the first treatise on Protestant theology, and
    many commentaries on the Bible and the classics. The
    spirit of his works is altogether ironic. Originally his
    name was Schwarzerd, German, meaning &ldquo;black earth&rdquo;
    and this he changed to Melanchthon, its Greek equivalent, <i>melan</i> &ldquo;black&rdquo;, and <i>chthon</i> &ldquo;earth&rdquo;. See <i>Luther</i>.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Memphremagog</span>: lake in Stanstead county, Quebec.</p>
<p>It is derived from the Abenaki term <i>mamhrobagak</i> meaning &ldquo;great extent of water&rdquo;. Magog, a small lake in
    Stanstead, is a diminutive of Memphremagog.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Merritt</span>: city in British Columbia.</p>
<p>The site was surveyed in 1906, and named in honour
    of William Hamilton Merritt, promoter of the railway
    running through the Nicola valley.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Merritton</span>: town in Welland county, Ontario, situated
    on the old Welland canal. Before it was incorporated as
    a village in 1879 it consisted of four sections: Slabtown,
    Cinderville, Westport and Welland-Valley. The place was
    incorporated as a town on July 1, 1918.</p>
<p>Merrittown was named after William Hamilton Merritt
    (1824-1906), founder of St. Catherines and promoter of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span> the Welland Canal. At one time Mr. Merritt represented
    Haldimand and Lincoln
    in parliament before and after the
    Union of 1841, and was
    President of the Imperial Bank of Canada for some years.
    The Merritt family were U.E. Loyalists and among the
    first settlers of Lincoln county. They were distinguished
    for enterprise, public spirit and unswerving allegiance to
    British Institutions.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Mersea</span>: township in Essex county, Ontario, erected
    in 1792.</p>
<p>It took its name from the island of Mersea in Blackwater
    Bay, Essex, England. The island is noted for its
    picturesque scenery.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Metcalfe</span>: township in Middlesex county, Ontario,
    instituted in 1847.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Sir Charles Metcalfe, 1785-1846,
    Governor-General of Canada, 1843-&rsquo;45. His nobility
    of character and capacity in statesmanship won for him
    deep appreciation both in India and Canada. On account
    of great suffering from a cancer in the face, Metcalfe was
    compelled to resign his office and return to England. For
    his services he was raised to the peerage as Baron
    Metcalfe in 1844.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Methuen</span>: township, Peterborough county, Ontario,
    surveyed in 1823.</p>
<p>It took its name from the Duke of Richmond, Lord
    Methuen. The village of Methuen is near the town of
    Perth, Scotland. The castle of the Methuen family
    adjoins the village.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Michipicoten</span>: island in Lake Superior and a harbour,
    river and village in Algoma district, Ontario.</p>
<p>Michipicoten is an Algonquin Indian word meaning
    &ldquo;the great bluff&rdquo;. Iron, copper and gold are extracted
    from the rocks of this district.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Middlesex</span>: county, Ontario, organized in 1796. At
    that date it included Elgin county within its boundaries.</p>
<p>It took its name from Middlesex county (that is, the
    country of the Middle Saxons), England.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Middleton</span>: township in Oxford county, Ontario, surveyed
    in 1792.</p>
<p>The origin of its name is uncertain. There are many
    villages in England by the name of Middleton. It was
    probably named after Sir William Middleton, M.P. for
    Northumberland or Lord Viscount Middleton of Whitchurch,
    both of whom voted against the Canada Bill or
    Constitutional Act of 1791.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Mildmay</span>: village in Bruce county, Ontario, incorporated
    in 1918.</p>
<p>This place was originally called Mernersville after
    Senator Samuel Merners who built a hotel here in the
    early days. About 1865 the name was change to Mildmay
    after Mildmay Park in Scotland by William Murray who
    built a grist mill in the village to serve the settlement.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Miller</span>: township in Frontenac county, Ontario,
    formed in 1860.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Hugh Miller, 1802-&rsquo;56, a
    famous geologist of Scotland. His more important contributions
    are entitled <i>Footprints of the Creator</i>, and <i>Testimony of the Rocks</i>.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Mills</span>: township in Parry Sound district, erected in
    1877, and also a township in Manitoulin Island, Ontario,
    erected in 1878.</p>
<p>Both were named in honour of the Hon. David Mills,
    a member of the legal profession, and an authority on
    history and constitutional law. He represented Bothwell
    (now included in Kent and Lambton), Ontario, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span> House of Commons, 1867-&rsquo;96, when he was appointed to
    the Senate. Mr. Mills was Minister of the Interior in
    Hon. Alexander Mackenzie&rsquo;s government, and succeeded
    Sir Oliver Mowat as Minister of Justice in Sir Wilfrid
    Laurier&rsquo;s government in 1897.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Milton</span>: county-town of Halton county, Ontario.</p>
<p>It is generally held to have been named in honour of
    John Milton (1608-&rsquo;74,) England&rsquo;s great Puritan poet,
    author of &ldquo;Paradise Lost&rdquo;, &ldquo;Paradise Regained&rdquo;,
    &ldquo;Comus&rdquo;, etc.</p>
<p>Previous to 1837-&rsquo;38 the place was known as Milltown,
    after Martin Mills, an early settler. It has been suggested
    that the early name was merged into Milton. It
    may be that the humbler name suggested the more
    exalted.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Milverton</span>: enterprising village in Perth county,
    Ontario.</p>
<p>It was founded in 1847 when Andrew West built the
    first shanty there. The place was known as West&rsquo;s
    Corners until 1871 when it was thought this name
    smacked too much of cross-roads. A public meeting was
    called. The Rev. Peter Musgrave, Presbyterian minister,
    suggested the name be changed to Milverton after his
    native village in Somerset county, England. The suggestion
    was accepted. The village was incorporated in 1880.</p>
<p>The site of the village was purchased by Mr. West
    from Mr. Joseph Hamilton, when but a few trees had been
    cut, for a pair of long boots.</p>
<p>Information received from Malcolm Macbeth, Esq.,
    postmaster of the village and editor of the Milverton Sun.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Mimico</span>: town in York county, Ontario.</p>
<p>The word is Mississauga Indian, meaning, &ldquo;the place
    of the wild pigeon&rdquo;. Dr. Scadding held the proper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span> spelling of the term was Mimica. The fields near Mimico
    creek used to be favourite feeding grounds for these birds
    which &ldquo;when they rose obscured the sun&rdquo; some fifty years
    ago. They, the American passenger pigeons, are now
    thought to be extinct.</p>

<p>It took its name from the town of Minden in Westphalia,
    Prussia. The British and Hanoverians won an
    important battle there over the French on August 1, 1759.
    &ldquo;I have seen&rdquo;, said the French commander, Contades,
    &ldquo;what I never thought to be possible&mdash;a single rank of
    infantry break through three lines of cavalry ranked in
    order of battle, and tumble them to ruin!&rdquo;</p>

    Governor-General of Canada, 1898-1904.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Miramichi</span>: river in New Brunswick.</p>
<p>Origin of the word is somewhat uncertain. Some
    think it is a corruption of the Indian term <i>megumagee</i>,
    &ldquo;the land of the Micmacs&rdquo;; others suppose the word
    Miramichi to be Micmac for &ldquo;happy retreat&rdquo;. See <i>Restigouche</i>.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Missisquoi</span>: county in southern Quebec.</p>
<p>The name is Indian and generally translated &ldquo;much
    water-fowl&rdquo;. Early settlers related dense flocks of fowl
    used to frequent the waters of this district.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Mississauga</span>: river in Algoma district, Ontario,
    emptying into Lake Huron.</p>
<p>From this river all the Indians inhabiting the north
    side of Lake Huron were called Mississaugas. They were
    of the Algonquin race and speech. Bands of them came
    south and were found in Simcoe&rsquo;s time (1792-&rsquo;96),
    encamped along the shore of Lake Ontario. The name is
    descriptive of the mouth of the river, <i>michi</i> or <i>missi</i>,

<p>They commemorated Lieut.-Gen. the Hon. Robert
    Monckton who was General Wolfe&rsquo;s first Brigadier before
    Quebec in 1759, Townshend and Murray being second and
    third respectively. Monckton was wounded in the battle
    of the Plains of Abraham but lived until 1782. The township
    name was spelled Monckton until 1786 when the
    New Brunswick law establishing parishes called it
    Moncton, presumably by clerical error. The city took its
    name and the spelling of it from the township.</p>
<p>Monckton City Council has decided recently (1930)
    that henceforth the city name shall be Monckton, in the
    interest of accuracy and correct spelling.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Monmouth</span>: township in Haliburton county (provisional),

    border between England and Wales.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Mono</span>: township in Dufferin county, Ontario, instituted

<p>The origin of its name is uncertain. The word <i>mono</i> is the Spanish word for monkey and since Sir Peregrine
    Maitland, who had served in Spain, was Lieutenant-Governor
    of Upper Canada at the time, it may have been
    given by him. Some writers think it may have been
    derived from an Indian word, Monon, a squaw concerning

    of a small river, in the county, which rises in Snow Lake
    and flows south into the St. Lawrence. There is a series
    of famous falls on the Montmorency River, remarkable
    for their picturesque scenery. It was on the east bank of
    this river that Wolfe&rsquo;s forces under Townshend received
    their first repulse in a flank movement on Montcalm&rsquo;s
    Beauport lines, July 8th, 1759.</p>

    arrived in 1882.</p>
<p>It took its name from Moose Jaw Creek, so named on
    Captain Palliser&rsquo;s map of 1859. The origin of the name is

    He was a true poet, one who wrote because he must.</p>
<p>The village is named after Lord Morpeth, a one-time
    guest of Colonel Thomas Talbot. (See <i>St. Thomas</i>). The
    title Morpeth is taken from the town and municipality of
    Morpeth in Northumberland county, England.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>
<p>The name morpeth is derived from old English <i>morth</i> (murth) and <i>peth</i> (path) meaning &ldquo;murder-road&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Morris</span>: township in Huron county, Ontario, formed
    in 1850.</p>
<p>It took its name from the Hon. William Morris of
    Perth, 1786-1858. He was a veteran of the War of 1812-&rsquo;14.
    In 1820 Mr. Morris was elected to Parliament for
    Lanark county, representing it continuously till 1836,
    when he was called to the Legislative Council. He was
    made Receiver-General in 1844 and President of the
    Executive Council in 1846, discharging all his duties with
    ability and probity.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Morrisburg</span>: charming village situated on the St.
    Lawrence River, Dundas county, Ontario. It was incorporated
    as a village by by-law of the county council,
    October 17th, 1860.</p>
<p>Morrisburg was named in honour of the Hon. James
    Morris, who was Postmaster-General in the Hincks-Morin
    government formed in 1851.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Morrison</span>: township in Muskoka district, Ontario,
    organized in 1860.</p>
<p>It is generally thought to have been named after
    Angus Morrison, M.P. for North Simcoe, 1854-&rsquo;63, who
    pressed upon the Government the desirability of opening
    up Muskoka district for settlement. He was Mayor of
    Toronto, 1876-&rsquo;78. Hon. J. C. Morrison, a brother of
    Angus, was Solicitor-General for Canada when this township
    was surveyed and some think it may have been
    named after him.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Mosa</span>: township in Middlesex county, Ontario, organized
    in 1821.</p>
<p>This is the Latin and Spanish name for the Meuse, and
    was, doubtless, given by Lieutenant-Governor Sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span> Peregrine Maitland. This river takes its rise in the
    Cote D&rsquo;Or Mountains of France and passes through the
    Netherlands under the name Maas, emptying into the
    North Sea by several mouths.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Moulton</span>: township in Haldimand county, Ontario,
    erected in 1825.</p>
<p>It took its name from the residence of the Boulton
    family in Lincolnshire, England. Henry J. Boulton was a
    member of the legal profession and rose to be Attorney-General
    in 1829. He was prominent in political affairs in
    Canada during most of the first half of the nineteenth
    century.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Mountain</span>: township in Dundas county, Ontario,
    formed in 1798.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Right Rev. Jacob Mountain,
    D.D., first Protestant Bishop of Quebec, 1750-1825. The
    family was originally French Protestant and the name
    Montaigne. Dr. Mountain was educated at Caius College,
    Cambridge, England. He was in many respects the
    founder of the Anglican Church in Canada.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Mowat</span>: township in Parry Sound district, Ontario,
    erected in 1879.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Hon. Sir Oliver Mowat,
    Premier of Ontario from 1872 to 1896, the longest term
    of office in the British Dominions. He was appointed
    Lieutenant-Governor of Ontario in 1898 and died before
    the expiration of his term.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Mulmur</span>: village and township in Dufferin county,
    Ontario, organized in 1822.</p>
<p>The origin of the name is uncertain. Mull and Mullmull
    are peculiar to Scotland. It is probably the corruption
    of an Indian name whose story has been forgotten.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Murchison</span>: township in Nipissing district, Ontario,
    organized in 1872.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Sir Roderick Impey
    Murchison, a British geologist, 1792-1871. In 1855 he
    was appointed Director-General of the Geological Survey
    of the British Isles.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Murray</span>: township, Northumberland county, Ontario,
    was surveyed in 1792.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Brigadier-General James
    Murray who served under General Wolfe in the taking of
    Louisbourg in 1758 and Quebec in 1759. After the
    capture he was appointed Governor of Quebec city, and in
    1763 Captain-General and Governor of the province of
    Quebec. Murray discharged his onerous duties with
    ability and singleness of purpose.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Muskoka</span>: district in Ontario, formed in 1868, and a
    township in this district, surveyed in 1857, and also of a
    lake, a river and a bay in the same area.</p>
<p>The word Muskoka is generally derived from the name
    of a Chippaway Indian chief, Misquuckkey, whose name is
    attached, among others, to two treaties made in 1815,
    surrendering 250,000 acres in this part of Ontario to the
    Crown for the sum of £4,000.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Naas</span>: river and bay, Cassiar district, B.C.</p>
<p>This name is a Tlingit Indian word meaning, &ldquo;satisfier
    of the stomach&rdquo; or &ldquo;food depot&rdquo;. The reference is to the
    abundance of fish found in these waters.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Nanaimo</span>: city, river and harbour, Vancouver Island,
    B.C.</p>
<p>The meaning of the word is &ldquo;strong, big, great&rdquo;.
    There used to be several small tribes of Indians in this
    vicinity, but, for protection, they formed &ldquo;one big union&rdquo;
    or confederacy and called themselves &ldquo;Esta Nanaimo&rdquo;.
    The whites called their early settlement Colville Town,
    after Andrew Colville, Governor of the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay
    Company, 1852-&rsquo;56, but after 1860 the Indian name,
    Nanaimo, came into general use. Information received
    from A. H. Horne, postmaster, whose father, Adam Grant
    Horne, settled in B.C. in 1850.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Napanee</span>: chief town and also river in Lennox county,
    Ontario.</p>
<p>There is some uncertainty about its origin. It is
    generally derived from Mississauga Indian, <i>Nan-pan-nay</i>,
    meaning &ldquo;flour&rdquo;, the milling of wheat being the town&rsquo;s
    first industry. On the other hand it is said the river
    was known as the Apanee before the first mill was erected,
    and that Napanee is a derivative from a term whose
    meaning is unknown.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Nassagaweya</span>: village, river and township in Halton
    county, Ontario. The township was surveyed in 1819.</p>
<p>The name is a corruption of the Mississauga Indian
    term, <i>Na-zhe-sah-ge-way-yong</i>, meaning &ldquo;a river with
    two ways or outlets&rdquo;. The village and township were
    named after the river.</p>

    about 1887 by a Mr. Sproat.</p>
<p>Its first name was Salisbury, after Lord Salisbury,
    sometime Premier of Great Britain and Ireland, then
    Stanley after Lord Stanley of Preston, sometime
    Governor-General of Canada, and later Nelson after Hon.
    Hugh Nelson (1830-1896), then Lieutenant-Governor of
    B.C. Post Office opened for the first time on August 1st,
    1889, and under the name of Nelson.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Nelson</span>: a river flowing from Lake Winnipeg into
    Hudson Bay, Man.</p>
<p>According to Luke Fox, or Foxe, an English navigator,
    who attempted the North-West Passage in 1631 and
    published his experiences under the name of North-West
    Fox, (Foxe), this river was named Port Nelson by Sir
    Thomas Button, an English navigator, in honour of his
    sailing master (Nelson) who was buried there. Button
    was frozen in and wintered on the west coast of Hudson
    Bay in 1612-&rsquo;13.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Nelson</span>: the name of a township in Halton county,
    Ontario, surveyed in 1806.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Horatio Viscount Nelson
    of the Nile and Duke of Bronte in Italy, 1758-1805. He
    was the son of Rev. Edmund Nelson and begun his career
    on the sea at the age of twelve years, becoming Tennyson&rsquo;s
    &ldquo;The greatest sailor since our world began&rdquo;. Nelson
    crowned his long and able service with his life in the
    battle of Trafalgar, Oct. 21st, 1805. It was at the
    beginning of this engagement that he gave his memorable
    signal, &ldquo;England expects every man to do his duty&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

    Under Secretary for the Colonies at this period.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Nepigon</span> (Nipigon): lake, river and bay in Thunder
    Bay district, Northern Ontario.</p>
<p>The word is a corruption of the Indian name, <i>Annimigon</i>,
    meaning &ldquo;lake that you cannot see the end of&rdquo;,
    according to <i>Picturesque Canada</i>, edited by G. M. Grant.
    Mr. R. Bell of the Geological Commission of Canada
    states Nepigon is Algonquin Indian meaning &ldquo;a deep lake
    of clear water&rdquo;. Other authorities derive the name from <i>Aweenipigo</i>, Indian for &ldquo;the water which stretches far&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Lake Nepigon might well be included in the St.
    Lawrence system of Great Lakes for it is full half as
    large as Lake Ontario, and the main source of the St.
    Lawrence.</p>
<p><span class="bold">New Brunswick</span>: one of the provinces of Canada, a
    part of the ancient French Acadie.</p>
<p>The American War of Independence, 1775-&rsquo;83, has
    been called the mother of New Brunswick. St. John was
    founded in 1793 by United Empire Loyalists. The next
    year New Brunswick was separated from Nova Scotia and
    erected into a separate province. The name was chosen
    as a compliment to King George III., 1760-1820, who was
    descended from the House of Hanover or Brunswick, a
    principality of Prussia.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Newcastle</span>: port of entry on Miramichi River, New

<p><span class="bold">Niagara</span>: river which empties the waters of Lake
    Erie into Lake Ontario; famous Falls of the river; and
    township in Lincoln county, Ontario, surveyed in 1798.</p>
<p>It is generally stated to be a Huron Indian word,
    meaning &ldquo;thunderer of waters, resounding with a great
    noise&rdquo;. Some writers hold the word is of neutral origin,
    others again maintain it is Iroquois, and interpret it
    variously as &ldquo;neck&rdquo; that is &ldquo;connecting water&rdquo;, &ldquo;divided
    waterfalls&rdquo;, &ldquo;bisected bottom land&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Nichol</span>: township in Wellington county, Ontario,
    erected in 1822.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Lieutenant-Colonel Robert
    Nichol who rendered invaluable services to Canada during
    the War of 1812-&rsquo;14. Richardson in his <i>War of 1812</i> states
    that &ldquo;Lieutenant-Colonel Robert Nichol of the 2nd
    Regiment of Norfolk Militia was appointed Quartermaster-General
    of Militia at the beginning of the war,
    and performed the arduous and important duties of that
    office to the entire satisfaction of the commanding officers.&rdquo;
    General Brock entrusted Col. Nichol with the
    arrangements for moving his force from Long Point to
    Amherstburg and for the crossing of the troops to Detroit
    on August 16th, 1812. It is said on every important question
    he was consulted by the officers in command. Col.
    Nichol received the gold medal for Detroit. He was elected
    member of the Legislative Assembly for Norfolk in
    1813, 1817, and in 1820. His death was caused by driving
    over the cliff on a stormy night near Queenston. He was
    buried in Stamford cemetery on the 6th of May, 1824.</p>

<p>It was named in honour of Florence Nightingale who
    organized and led a band of hospital nurses to attend the
    sick and wounded soldiers in the Crimean War, 1854-&rsquo;56.
    This was an innovation and Miss Nightingale won the
    world&rsquo;s admiration for her efforts to relieve the sufferings

<p><span class="bold">Nipissing</span>: district in Ontario, formed in 1858, a township
    in this district, surveyed in 1879, and a lake and
    village in the southern part of the district.</p>
<p>The lake was the first to receive the name, the Indian

    comparison with the Great Lakes.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Nissouri</span>: township, East, in Oxford county, and
    Nissouri township, West, in Middlesex county, were both

<p>The origin of the name is uncertain. Some writers
    think it is related to the Indian word Missouri which
    means &ldquo;muddy water&rdquo;. Many residents think it is a
    corruption of &ldquo;Nigh Zorra&rdquo; to which letters were
    addressed in the early days. Zorra is the name of an

<p><span class="bold">Niven</span>: township in Nipissing district, Ontario, surveyed

<p><span class="bold">Nootka</span>: island and sound, west coast of B.C.</p>
<p>They were named by the noted British sailor and
    explorer, Captain James Cook, in 1778. He was under
    the impression that this word was the Indian name for
    the Sound but some authorities state there is no such
    Indian word.</p>
<p>However, Cook may have made a tour of the sound
    which is somewhat circular, in his boats, and in conversation
    with the Indians about it they may have used the
    term <i>nootk-sitl</i> which means to go round, to make a
    circuit and he mistook this phrase for an Indian name
    and corrupted it into Nootka.</p>
<p>Another conjecture is that the Indians were holding a
    dance in a circle on the beach when Cook returned from
    exploring the Sound and when asked what they were
    doing, used a derivative of <i>nootk-sitl</i> which the white
    men mistook for a reference to their name of the place.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Norfolk</span>: county in Ontario, formed in 1792.</p>

<p>The settlement was founded in 1820 by a family

    last survivor of this family, Alexander McNabb, had the
    name changed to Norval. He owned a large sheep run on
    the hills about the village, which he called the Grampian
    Hills. Both names were taken from a dramatic composition

<p><span class="bold">Notre Dame</span>: a succession of ridges which enter
    Quebec between Lakes Champlain and Memphremagog,
    and continue in a north-easterly direction across the
    country to a point about thirty miles south of the St.
    Lawrence. Thence they follow the general course of the
    river to form the table-land of Gaspé and the Shick-shock
    Mountains. The Notre Dame Mountains are but a spur of
    the great Appalachian (from Apalachi, an Indian tribe,
    meaning &ldquo;those by the sea&rdquo;), range along the eastern
    United States.</p>
<p>Notre Dame is French, meaning &ldquo;Our Lady&rdquo;. The
    reference is to Mary, the Mother of Christ. This name
    was given by Champlain, &ldquo;Father of New France&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>
<p>John Mason Clarke in his story of Gaspesia entitled <i>The Heart of Gaspé</i> states that the Micmac word from
    which Shick-shock is derived means &ldquo;Rocky Mountains&rdquo;.
    The name appears to have been first applied in 1857 on
    a map of counties Gaspé and Bonaventure, published by
    the Crown Lands Department, Toronto, Joseph Cauchon,
    Commissioner.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Nottawasaga</span>: bay, river, and township, in Simcoe
    county, Ontario. The township was erected in 1832.</p>
<p>The name is derived from the Algonquin words

    &ldquo;outlet of river&rdquo;. The Iroquois used to come north to
    attack the Algonquins by way of the Nottawasaga River.</p>

    Captain L. E. G. Oates of the Inniskilling Dragoons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oates was an Eton College boy&mdash;Eton where the
    teachers seek to make real men. When the writer visited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span> Eton in 1913 a senior boy showed him over the building.
    The oaken wainscotting, doors, desks, etc., of the headmaster&rsquo;s
    room (Assembly), are completely covered with
    the names of former students. Each boy on completing
    his course has the privilege of having his name carved
    here. The boy pointed with pride to the names of many
    famous in the public life of the Empire, and talked glibly
    of their achievements. When he came to the name of
    Oates on the master&rsquo;s desk, not a word was said, but,
    the boy removed his school cap, and we looked into each
    other&rsquo;s soul. Both stood for a moment beside the brave
    Captain in the awful blizzard in which he passed on,
    seeking to save his comrades.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Odessa</span>: large and enterprising village in Lennox
    county, Ontario.</p>
<p>This place was founded under the name of Mill Creek.
    In 1854 it was named Odessa by the Post Office Department
    of Canada. In that year what is known as the
    Crimean War, 1854-1856, had broken out between Russia
    and Turkey, England and France taking up the quarrel
    on the side of Turkey. An Anglo-French squadron bombarded
    Odessa, southern port of Russia, but without
    result, hence the name.</p>
<p>Odessa is a flourishing city, picturesquely situated on
    an inlet of the Black Sea. It possesses a fine university
    and an international museum of antiquities.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Oka</span>: Indian village in the county of Two Mountains,
    Quebec. It is situated on the Lake of Two Mountains, an
    expansion of the Ottawa River, thirty-six miles from
    Montreal.</p>
<p>Oka is an Algonquin Indian word signifying a species
    of fish called doré, plentiful in the Lake of Two Mountains.
    This fish is commonly called John Dory, from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span> French &ldquo;jaune doreé&rdquo;, meaning <i>yellow gill</i>, a tinge of the
    doré.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Okanagan</span>: lake, river (affluent of Columbia), valley,
    and town in Yale district, British Columbia.</p>
<p>According to Professor Boas, of Columbia University,
    Okanagan is derived from Okinagen, the name of a Salish
    tribe of Indians. The meaning of the word in English is
    uncertain. It may be a corruption of <i>kana</i>, &ldquo;the place of&rdquo;
    and <i>gan</i>, &ldquo;water, lake&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Okotoks</span>: town, also mountains, south of Calgary,
    Alberta. The town is a flourishing distribution centre for
    the Turner Valley oil field.</p>
<p>The name is Blackfoot Indian meaning &ldquo;lots of
    stones&rdquo;, referring to the ford of Sheep Creek on the Calgary-McLeod
    Trail.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Olden</span>: township in Frontenac county, Ontario, formed
    in 1823.</p>
<p>It took its name from John Olden who surveyed it.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Oneida</span>: township in Haldimand county, erected in
    1835.</p>
<p>It took its name from the Oneida tribe of Indians. The
    term is a corruption of a compound word, formed from <i>onenhia</i>, &ldquo;stone&rdquo;, and <i>kaniote</i>, &ldquo;upright&rdquo;. It was applied
    to a large boulder on an eminence near which the Oneidas
    had their chief village.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Onondaga</span>: township in Brant county, Ontario, organized
    in 1840. It is largely an Indian Reserve.</p>
<p>The word is a corruption of <i>onontake</i> meaning &ldquo;at the
    mountain&rdquo;. The site of this tribe&rsquo;s early home in New
    York State stretched along the back and sloping sides of
    a great hill, hence the name.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Ontario</span>: province of Canada, known as Upper Canada
    from its erection in 1791 to the passing of the British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span> North America Act of 1867; a county in Ontario, cut off
    from York county in 1849; and one of Canada&rsquo;s Great
    Lakes.</p>
<p>The word is a corruption of the Iroquois Indian phrase <i>kanadario</i>, according to Hennepin, which means &ldquo;sparkling
    or beautiful water&rdquo;, and was used by the aboriginals
    to describe only the handsome lake now known as
    Ontario.</p>
<p>The white settlers gave the name to the land along
    the lake&rsquo;s shores and later to an ever-extending area.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Ops</span>: township in Victoria county, Ontario, formed in
    1821.</p>
<p>It is a Latin word meaning &ldquo;riches, abundance&rdquo;, whatever
    puts people in a position to do great things. The
    Romans personified Ops as the goddess of plenty.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Orangeville</span>: thriving town in Dufferin county,
    Ontario.</p>
<p>In 1832 James Greggs erected a flour mill and a saw
    mill on the site of the town and for several years it was
    known as the Mills. In 1844 Orange Lawrence bought
    both mills and shortly after one of the early settlers wrote
    the Governor-General of Canada, suggesting the place be
    called Orangeville in honour of their chief captain of
    industry. The suggestion was accepted. The story of the
    origin of the name was received from the present postmaster,
    Geo. H. Harshaw, son of Moses Harshaw.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Orford</span>: township in Kent county, Ontario, erected in
    1794.</p>
<p>It took its name from the town of Orford in Suffolk,
    England, and was, doubtless, suggested by Lieutenant-Governor
    Simcoe. Sir Robert Walpole was made Earl of
    Orford in 1742.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>
<p>Orford is also the name of a canton in Sherbrooke
    county, and of a lake in Brome county, Quebec.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Orillia</span>: enterprising town situated on the shores of
    Lake Simcoe; and a township in Simcoe county, Ontario,
    surveyed in 1822.</p>
<p>A magnificent monument to Champlain adorns Orillia.
    It was designed by the late Vernon March, a brilliant
    young sculptor of England, and erected in 1925 to commemorate
    the 300th anniversary of Champlain&rsquo;s visit to
    the site of this town.</p>
<p>The origin of the name is much disputed. Some
    scholars maintain the word is Spanish and means &ldquo;border,
    bank, shore&rdquo;. If so, it was given, no doubt, by Sir
    Peregrine Maitland, Lieutenant-Governor of the period,
    who had formerly served in the British army in Spain,
    or by time-expired soldiers from Wellington&rsquo;s army who
    settled here.</p>
<p>Other writers state that the name is derived from the
    Indian word <i>orelia</i> which the red man applied to a berry
    growing in the neighbouring bush.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Oro</span>: village and township in Simcoe county, Ontario,
    erected in 1820.</p>
<p>It is the Spanish word for gold, and was chosen in all
    likelihood by Sir Peregrine Maitland. Rio del Oro was
    then and is still the name of a river and town in Spanish
    Territory, west coast of Africa. A considerable trade in
    gold and slaves was carried on with this Territory at that
    period, and as it had been suggested that this township
    be set aside for liberated slaves, the African name was
    thought appropriate.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Oromocto</span>: island, lake, village, and river in York and
    Sunbury counties, New Brunswick.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>
<p>The word is Maliseet Indian and means &ldquo;good river&rdquo;,
    free from obstructions to canoe navigation. The term
    was applied by the Aborigines to the river only.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Orono</span>: village in Durham county, Ontario.</p>
<p>There is a town by the name of Orono in the State of
    Maine, U.S.A. Many of the first settlers in Durham
    were U.E. Loyalists from the New England States. They
    brought the name of their former home with them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Maine town was named from a distinguished
    chief of the Tarratine tribe of Indians.&rdquo;&mdash;Maine Register.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Osgoode</span>: township in Carleton county, Ontario, surveyed
    in 1798.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of William Osgoode, 1750-1824,
    who came from England with Lieutenant-Governor
    Simcoe in 1791. He was made Chief-Justice of Upper
    Canada in 1792, transferred to Lower Canada in 1794,
    retaining the office for ten years when he retired with an
    allowance of £800 a year. Osgoode Hall, Toronto,
    the seat of the Supreme Court and Law School of Ontario,
    is named after him.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Oshawa</span>: enterprising city in Ontario.</p>
<p>The word is Seneca Indian in origin and means &ldquo;The
    Carrying Place&rdquo;, according to <i>Picturesque Canada</i>. Here
    was an old portage leading from the shore of Lake
    Ontario to Lake Scugog.</p>
<p>Joseph Gould, a pioneer of this district, in the story of
    his life states the word Oshawa is Indian for &ldquo;Salmon
    Creek&rdquo;, a term the natives applied to a local stream which
    well deserved the name.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Osler</span>: township in Nipissing district, Ontario, formed
    in 1883.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Hon. Featherston Osler,
    1838-1924, a judge of the Court of Common Pleas. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span> was a son of the Rev. F. L. Osler, of Newmarket. Other
    distinguished sons of this clergyman were Britton Bath
    Osler, Q.C., Edmund Boyd Osler, financier, and Dr.
    William Osler, professor of medicine. All are dead.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Osnabruck</span>: township in Stormont county, Ontario,
    erected in 1787.</p>
<p>It took its name from Osnabruck, a town and province
    in Hanover. They belonged to the House of Brunswick.
    The township was so named in honour of Frederick, Duke
    of York, son of King George III., hereditary lord and
    bishop before he ceded Osnabruck to Hanover.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Oso</span>: township in Frontenac county, Ontario, formed
    in 1823.</p>
<p>It is the Spanish word for &ldquo;bear&rdquo;, a fierce animal.
    It is another evidence of Lieutenant-Governor Sir
    Peregrine Maitland&rsquo;s sojourn in Spain.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Osprey</span>: township in Grey county, Ontario, surveyed
    in 1822.</p>
<p>The osprey (fish hawk) arrives in Ontario in early
    spring, remaining generally for only a few days and then
    passing on to the Arctic where the young are reared. The
    surveyors may have run across a pair that had settled in
    Grey for the summer and suggested the name. There was
    a ship in the British Navy called the <i>Osprey</i> from which
    the township may have taken its name.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Otonabee</span>: township in Peterborough county, Ontario,
    erected in 1820.</p>
<p>It is an Indian word and means &ldquo;water at the mouth
    of a river&rdquo;, and was used by the Aborigines to describe
    only the waters of the delta of the river now called the
    Otonabee emptying into Rice Lake.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Ottawa</span>: the capital of Canada, and a grand river, an
    affluent of the unrivalled St. Lawrence.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>
<p>The city was called Bytown until 1865, after Colonel
    By of the Royal Engineers to whom the British Government
    entrusted the construction of the Rideau canal. The
    word Ottawa is generally derived from the Indian term <i>adawe</i>, &ldquo;to trade&rdquo;. The name was given to the Indian
    tribe who dwelt along this river because its members were
    good hunters and brought fine furs to market. The
    French missionaries Belcourt and Lafleche say that the
    name Ottawas was given by the Algonquins to those
    Indians who had &ldquo;grand or decorated ears&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Ross in his <i>Ottawa Past and Present</i> derives the word
    from the Outwuak of the Jesuit Relations, &ldquo;an Indian
    tribe which lived at the north end of Lake Huron and
    only came down the Ottawa River periodically to trade
    with Montreal merchants."</p>
<p><span class="bold">Owen Sound</span>: flourishing city in Grey county, Ontario,
    situated at the foot of Owen Sound, an arm of Georgian
    Bay, at the mouth of the Sydenham River. The place was
    originally called Sydenham and was founded by John
    Telfer, Government Land Agent, in 1840.</p>
<p>The name was changed later to Owen Sound in honour
    of Lieutenant Owen, Navigating Officer for Commander
    Bayfield who made the survey of the bay, 1822-&rsquo;24.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Oxford</span>: county in Ontario, and also three townships
    in the county, East, West and North. There is also a
    township by this name in Grenville county, Ontario. It
    was named Oxford on the Rideau. All were organized in
    1798.</p>
<p>They took their name from the city of Oxford in
    England. The name is derived from a ford of the river
    Thames. The word was originally Oxnaford, and here at
    the confluence of the Cherwell and Thames, was, perhaps,
    the most historic ford in England.</p>

<h2><a name="P" id="P">P</a></h2>
<p><span class="bold">Paisley</span>: flourishing town in Bruce county, Ontario.</p>
<p>The place took its name from Paisley, Scotland. In
    1158 the word was written Paisleth meaning probably
    &ldquo;at the front of the slope&rdquo;, which suits the site of the old
    town. The name is derived from the Gaelic <i>bathais</i>,
    &ldquo;front&rdquo; or &ldquo;brow&rdquo; and <i>leathad</i> &ldquo;a slope, declivity&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Here by the beautiful Saugeen of the Canadian Paisley
    Isabella Valancy Crawford lived her girlhood days, receiving
    her first impressions of nature&rsquo;s sublimity. Many of
    her poems attest the depth of her sensibilities as she
    absorbed the beauty about her.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Pakenham</span>: town and township in Lanark county,
    Ontario, erected in 1823.</p>
<p>They were named in honour of General Sir Edward
    Michael Pakenham, 1778-1815, killed at the battle of New
    Orleans while galloping along the front line to animate
    the British troops by his presence.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Palermo</span>: historic village in Trafalgar township,
    Halton county, Ontario.</p>
<p>This district was settled by U.E. Loyalists who
    arrived shortly after the close of the War of Independence,
    1775-&rsquo;83.</p>
<p>The village took its name from Palermo in Sicily. The
    Bay of Palermo was a temporary base for the division of
    the British navy under Admiral Nelson in the earlier
    years of the Peninsular War, 1793-1815. Palermo is the
    least glorious name in the annals of his career.</p>
<p>No city of Italy is more beautifully situated than
    Palermo. It is a noted manufacturing centre with a vast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span> commercial trade. It is thought to have been founded by
    the Ph&#339;nicians and was known to them by the Greek
    name, Panormus, which signifies &ldquo;a haven for all&rdquo;, in
    allusion to its fine harbour.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Palmerston</span>: township in Frontenac county, Ontario,
    organized in 1822, and town in Wellington county.</p>
<p>Both were named in honour of Henry John Temple,
    third Viscount Palmerston, 1784-1865. He entered the
    British Parliament at the age of twenty-one and held
    office for nearly fifty years, becoming Premier in 1855,
    and was head of the ministry for nearly ten years. His
    policy was inaction at home and neutrality abroad.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Papineau</span>: township in Nipissing district, Ontario,
    formed in 1878, and also a canton in Labelle county,
    Quebec, erected in 1919.</p>
<p>They were named after Louis Joseph Papineau, 1786-1871.
    He was the outstanding leader of the Rebellion in
    Lower Canada in 1837-&rsquo;38, until insurrection broke out
    and then he sought safety in flight. After ten years in
    exile in the United States and France, Papineau returned
    to Canada.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Paris</span>: picturesque town in Brant county, Ontario.
    The place is divided into upper and lower town by the
    Nith River, which, after winding through romantic glens,
    joins the Grand River.</p>
<p>The settlement here was called &ldquo;The Forks of the
    Grand River&rdquo; until about 1836. One, Hiram Capron, a
    business man from Vermont, who had established a
    plaster mill in the village, called a public meeting and
    protested against having to head all his letters with such
    a long name. He suggested Paris both for convenience
    and for the crude plaster of Paris in the locality. Capron
    was their greatest captain of industry and his shrewd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span> suggestion was accepted by the residents. Gypsum
    deposits extend on the Grand River from Paris to Cayuga,
    thirty-five miles.</p>
<p>Plaster of Paris is so called from having been originally
    obtained from Montmartre in the environs of Paris.
    The word Paris was derived from Parisii, a tribe of
    Gauls, who dwelt on the site of the city when the country
    was conquered by the Romans.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Parry Sound</span>: district in Ontario, formed in 1870;
    a town in the district and its harbour, and also an island
    in Georgian Bay, adjacent to the town.</p>
<p>They were named after Parry or Melville Sound in the
    north polar regions of Canada, and it was named in
    honour of Sir William Edward Parry, 1790-1855, who
    made several voyages in search of the North-West Passage,
    and published illuminating accounts of his adventures
    and discoveries.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Patricia</span>: unorganized district in Northern Ontario,
    from 1912 to 1927 when by &ldquo;the Patricia Act&rdquo; of the
    Province of Ontario it was annexed to and made part of
    the territorial district of Kenora, to be known as &ldquo;District
    of Kenora, Patricia Portion&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Princess Patricia, daughter
    of His Royal Highness, Duke of Connaught, Governor-General
    of Canada, 1911-&rsquo;16. The first Canadian Contingent,
    Great War, 1914-&rsquo;18, was named the Princess Pat&rsquo;s
    Light Infantry. She presented the corps with regimental
    colours made by herself. At the close of the War the
    Princess married Captain Ramsay of the British Navy.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Patterson</span>: township in Parry Sound district, surveyed

<p><span class="bold">Peace</span>: river in Alberta and B.C.</p>
<p>Sir Alexander Mackenzie, in the account of his voyage
    in 1793 to the Pacific, states:</p>
<div class="blockquot">
    <p>&ldquo;On October 13th at noon we came to the Peace point, from
        which, according to the report of my interpreter, the river derives

    a distinguished British statesman.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Pelee Island</span>: township in Essex county, Ontario.</p>
<p>It took its name from Point Pelee on the mainland of
    Essex. This name was given by the French explorers.
    The word Pelee means &ldquo;bare&rdquo;, and the east side consisted
    largely of sand banks, no trees.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Pelham</span>: township in Welland county, Ontario, organized
    in 1790.</p>
<p>It took its name from the Pelham family, several of
    whom held office in the British Government during the
    reigns of George II. and George III. Thomas Pelham,
    1693-1768, Duke of Newcastle, was Prime Minister for
    nearly ten years. He was not a great statesman, but
    honest, industrious and energetic. Newcastle twice
    refused a pension and left office £300,000 poorer than
    when he entered the government.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Pembina</span>: river, mountain and county in Manitoba, an

<p><span class="bold">Pembroke</span>: thriving town on the Ottawa River in the
    county of Renfrew, Ontario, and a township in the same
    county, formed in 1843. Pembrokeshire is the name of a

    Ontario, situated on an arm of Georgian Bay and possessing
    a fine harbour.</p>
<p>The name is Abenaki Indian and means &ldquo;the place of
    white falling sands&rdquo;. On the western side of the harbour
    there is a great sandy cliff, pieces of which are continually
    breaking away. The place-name of Penetanguishene
    remains an imperishable cenotaph of an almost extinct
    nation.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Penticton</span>: thriving town situated near the southern
    extremity of Lake Okanagan, Yale county, B.C. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span> first white man to settle here was Thomas Ellis in 1867.
    The Southern Okanagan Land Company purchased from
    Mr. Ellis in 1905 and laid the land out in fruit lots.
    This was the beginning of the town&rsquo;s modern development.</p>
<p>The name Penticton is of Indian derivation meaning
    &ldquo;meeting of the ways&rdquo;. Probably it is a shortened Indian
    phrase for &ldquo;getting-off place at the end of big water&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Percé</span>: village, and canton in the county of Gaspé,
    erected in 1842.</p>

    of Northumberland. So powerful did the family
    become that they were often a peril to the throne, notably
    so in Henry IV.&rsquo;s and Elizabeth&rsquo;s reigns. If the name were
    to be translated to Canada it was appropriately placed in
    Northumberland.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Perry</span>: township in Parry Sound district, Ontario,
    erected in 1873.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of George Perry, 1818-&rsquo;91,
    M.P.P. for North Oxford from 1867-&rsquo;72 and Sheriff of
    Oxford from 1873 till his death. In younger days he was
    a distinguished teacher and a man of very high character.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Perth</span>: the county-town of Lanark county, Ontario,
    and also a county in the same province, formed from the
    Canada Land Company&rsquo;s Huron district in 1847.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>
<p>Both were named after the town of Perth on the Tay
    River in Perthshire, Scotland.</p>
<p>The name is probably derived from Gaelic <i>barr tha</i> meaning, &ldquo;height over the Tay&rdquo;, i.e. Kinnoull Hill, or
    from <i>aber tha</i> &ldquo;confluence of the Tay&rdquo; with the Earn.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Petawawa</span>: river in Ontario, a branch of the Ottawa.</p>
<p>It is a corruption of the Algonquin Indian <i>pitwewe</i>,
    meaning &ldquo;where one hears a noise like this&rdquo;, the voice of
    the waters according to the Indian fancy. Petawawa is
    also the name of a township in Renfrew county, Ontario,
    organized in 1857.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Peterborough</span>: county and its county-town in Ontario.</p>
<p>Christopher Robinson, a U.E. Loyalist, removed from
    Virginia to Canada after the Revolutionary War. His
    son, Colonel Peter Robinson, was sent out to Canada in
    1825 by Earl Bathurst with over 2000 emigrants from
    Ireland. He conducted them to Indian Plains (Peterborough
    county) and settled them on free government
    lands. A town sprang up where he encamped the emigrants
    and his friends insisted it be called after him,
    Peter&rsquo;s borough or Peterborough. The county was organized
    in 1849 under the same name.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Petitcodiac</span>: river in New Brunswick emptying into
    Shepody Bay, an arm of the Bay of Fundy; and also a
    village situated on the same river, in the county of
    Westmoreland.</p>
<p>Petitcodiac is a Micmac Indian word, in the opinion of
    most authorities, meaning &ldquo;the bend in a bow fitted to an
    arrow&rdquo;, descriptive of the winding course of the river.</p>
<p>Some derive the term from the French <i>petit coude</i> meaning &ldquo;the little elbow&rdquo; in reference to the river&rsquo;s
    course in the vicinity of Monckton. This derivation is not
    probable.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Petrolia</span>: thriving town in Lambton county, Ontario.
    It was incorporated as a village in 1867 and as a town in
    1874.</p>
<p>The town was named by the first postmaster, Patrick
    Barclay, and the name is derived from petroleum, the
    production of which is the staple industry of the place.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Pickering</span>: village, and also township, in Ontario
    county, province of Ontario, organized in 1792.</p>
<p>At first the township was designated Edinburgh but
    renamed Pickering. It took its name from the town of
    Pickering in Yorkshire, England.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Picton</span>: the county-town of Prince Edward county,
    Ontario.</p>
<p>It was named in memory of Major-General Sir
    Thomas Picton who led the 5th Division in the battle of
    Waterloo, June 18, 1815, and fell in the action.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Pictou</span>: village and county, Nova Scotia, and also an
    island in the strait of Northumberland.</p>
<p>The origin of the word is uncertain. Some think it a
    corruption of Poictou, the name of a province in France,
    and that the district was so named by the French
    explorers.</p>
<p>Rand derives the word from the Micmac <i>pictook</i>,
    meaning &ldquo;fire caused by the explosion of gas&rdquo;, explained
    by the presence of coal mines in the immediate vicinity.</p>
<p>Other writers think Pictou a corruption of the Micmac <i>bucto</i> which signifies &ldquo;fire&rdquo;. Tradition relates that a
    large Micmac encampment at this place was destroyed by
    a great fire and the Micmacs ever afterwards pointed the
    place out to the whites as the scene of <i>mickeak bucto</i>, &ldquo;a
    great fire&rdquo;. This is the most probable derivation.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Pilkington</span>: township in Wellington county, Ontario,
    erected in 1851.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>
<p>It took its name from General Robert Pilkington. As
    a lieutenant in the Royal Engineers he was stationed at
    Fort Niagara in 1795. Pilkington was a capable officer,
    became a favourite of Lieutenant-Governor Simcoe&rsquo;s, and
    received a grant of 20,000 acres of land, known for some
    years as the Pilkington Block, afterwards incorporated
    into Pilkington township.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Pilot Mound</span>: town in southern central Manitoba.</p>
<p>It took its name from an old Indian mound there that
    guided or piloted pioneers coming in over the old Emerson
    trail of the 1880&rsquo;s.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Pittsburg</span>: township in Frontenac county, Ontario,
    organized in 1787.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of the Right Honourable
    William Pitt, (1759-1806), second son of William Pitt,
    first Earl of Chatham. He studied law and became a
    member of the bar at twenty-one, at twenty-three he was
    Chancellor of the Exchequer and at twenty-five he was
    Premier of Great Britain. Pitt was the author of the
    Canadian Constitutional Act of 1791. This illustrious
    statesman was buried beside his father in Westminster
    Abbey.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Plantaganet</span>: township in Prescott county, Ontario,
    formed in 1798.</p>
<p>It took its name from a line of kings of England of
    whom Henry II. was the first. Geoffrey of Anjou, Henry&rsquo;s
    father, wore a sprig of broom or <i>planta genista</i> as his
    device. Some historians called this Royal House the
    Plantaganets and others the Angevins, or descendants of
    the Count of Anjou.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Plympton</span>: township in Lambton county, Ontario,
    organized in 1834.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>
<p>It was named after the town of Plympton in Devonshire,
    England, near which was Beechwood, a residence of
    Sir John Colborne who was Lieutenant-Governor of
    Upper Canada from 1829 to 1835.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Pointe-aux-Trembles</span>: parish, county of Portneuf, and
    village on the island of Montreal, Quebec. These places
    were famous for their aspen trees with their continuously
    quivering leaves, hence the name.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Pointe de Bute</span>: historic community on the Missaquash,
    New Brunswick. This place figured prominently
    in the struggle between the English and the French in
    1755.</p>
<p>The name is a corruption of Pont à Buot meaning
    Buot&rsquo;s Bridge. Buot was probably an Acadian.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Pontiac</span>: county in Quebec.</p>
<p>So named to commemorate the noted chief of the
    Ottawas, an Algonquin tribe. Pontiac, 1712-1769, was a
    steadfast ally of the French, contributed largely to
    Braddock&rsquo;s defeat in 1755, and organized a compact
    among the Indian tribes in 1763 with the view of
    exterminating English settlers.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Port Alberni</span>: city in British Columbia, situated at the
    head of the Alberni Canal. For origin of name see <i>Alberni</i>.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Port Arthur</span>: city situated on Lake Superior, Thunder
    Bay district, Ontario.</p>
<p>It was named Prince Arthur&rsquo;s Landing by Colonel
    Wolseley in 1870, on his expedition to the Red River
    Settlement, in honour of Prince Arthur, now Duke of
    Connaught, and Governor-General of Canada from 1911
    to 1916. In 1883 this name was changed to Port Arthur
    to correspond with Port Moody, the western accepted
    terminus of the C.P.R. at that time.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Port Burwell</span>: police village, situated on Lake Erie,
    Elgin county, Ontario, incorporated in 1900.</p>
<p>It was founded in 1817 by Mahlon Burwell, a pioneer,
    and named after him.</p>
<p>The name Burwell is derived from Old English <i>burgh</i> meaning &ldquo;a castle&rdquo; and <i>wella</i>, &ldquo;a spring or well of water&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The name was probably given at first to the man who
    had charge of a castle well.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Port Coquitlam</span>: new city in B.C. The post office was
    opened March 1, 1891.</p>
<p>Coquitlam is the name of a Salish Indian tribe.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Port Dover</span>: port and town in Norfolk county, Ontario,
    and port and village in Halifax county, Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>Both are named after Dover, Kent county, England.
    The town is situated on the River Douver still correctly
    pronounced Douvre(s). The name is French in origin,
    meaning &ldquo;a stream&rdquo;. It is the Welsh <i>dwfr</i> meaning
    &ldquo;water&rdquo;. The town took its name from the river. It is
    another example of the general names of primitive
    peoples taking on a proper signification on the advance
    of civilization.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Port Hope</span>: picturesque and progressive town in
    Durham county, Ontario.</p>
<p>The first white settler on the site of the town was one
    Peter Smith, a trader and hunter, who established himself
    here about 1778. An Indian village in the locality
    was called Cochingomink and Smith built his cabin on a
    creek which ran through it. In process of time both the
    creek and settlement became known as Smith&rsquo;s Creek.</p>
<p>By 1792 U.E. Loyalists began to arrive, and take up
    farms, Mr. Myndert Harris and family pioneering the
    way. In 1815 Jeremiah Britton opened up the first store.
    Smith&rsquo;s Creek soon fell into disuse and Toronto was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span> substituted therefor. But when a post office was opened
    in 1817 the duality of names gave rise to confusion. In
    1819 a public meeting was called and G. S. Bolton, a
    resident, suggested Port Hope, which was unanimously
    adopted.</p>
<p>No one seems to know why Hope was made the choice
    of the residents, no record of the meeting bearing on this
    point having come to light. However, in all probability
    it was named in honour of Colonel Henry Hope, Lieutenant-Governor
    of Canada from 1785 to his death in 1789.
    He was a true friend to all the people of Canada and was
    particularly careful in considering the fortunes of the new
    Loyalist settlers on the banks of the St. Lawrence River
    and Lake Ontario, of which there were 1,800. The
    Government had undertaken to furnish provisions only
    until May, 1786. Pointing out that destitution would
    arise, Hope had the period extended until the crops were
    harvested. He had a Commission appointed also to
    investigate and adjust all Loyalist claims. It is not at all
    likely that the U.E. Loyalists were unmindful of his
    vital services.</p>
<p>As a mark of respect the citizens of Quebec City called
    the gate finished in 1784, leading from the upper town to
    the ramp descending to Saint Roch suburb, after him. At
    this time it was first known as &ldquo;Hope Gate&rdquo; which name it
    still bears.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Portland</span>: township in Frontenac county, Ontario,
    organized in 1798, and a village situated in Rideau Lake
    in Leeds county, Ontario.</p>
<p>They were named in honour of William Henry
    Cavendish Bentinck, third Duke of Portland, who became
    Secretary of the Colonies in the British Government in
    1796. The family is descended from the Dutch friend of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span> King William III., William Bentinck, who sought to save
    the Prince&rsquo;s life by lying in bed with him when he had the
    smallpox. When William of Orange became King of
    England he showered estates and honours on Bentinck.</p>
<p>The title was taken from the Isle of Portland in
    Dorsetshire, famous for its bed of rock known as Portland
    stone out of which many of the beautiful mansions of
    England have been erected.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Port McNichol</span>: village port on Georgian Bay, Simcoe
    county, Ontario.</p>
<p>It was founded about 1909 by the Canadian Pacific
    Railway and named in honour of its Vice-President at
    that time, the late David McNichol.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Port Moody</span>: city on Burrard inlet, B.C.</p>
<p>It was named in 1860 by Captain Richards, H.M.
    surveying vessel <i>Plumper</i>, in honour of Major-General
    Richard Clement Moody (1813-&rsquo;87), at that time commissioner
    of lands and works of British Columbia. Port
    Moody was originally chosen for the Pacific terminus of
    the Canadian Pacific Railway. It lost much of its
    importance when the road was extended to Vancouver at
    its completion in 1886.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Port Neuf</span>: rivers, one in Saguenay county, and the
    other in Port Neuf county, Quebec.</p>
<p>On the latter river Pierre Robineau, member of the
    One Hundred Associates, built an establishment which he
    called Portneuf, &ldquo;new port&rdquo;, hence the name, according to
    some authorities. Others presume the word was coined
    by Le Neuf de la Potherie, who obtained a seigniory here,
    by adjoining &ldquo;port&rdquo; to the second syllable of his name.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Port Perry</span>: picturesque village in Ontario county,
    Ontario.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>
<p>In 1827 Elder Scott of the American Missionary
    Society established an Indian school on the lake front
    where Port Perry is now situated. The first general store
    was opened by Chester Draper in 1840.</p>
<p>The village has been known as Port Perry from about
    1852. It was named after Peter Perry of Whitby who
    laid out the first town plot. Previous to that date it was
    called Scugog Village. Information received from Thos.
    H. Follick, M.A., Principal of Port Perry High School.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Port Weller</span>: name of the Lake Ontario entrance to
    the new Welland Ship Canal now (1930) nearing
    completion.</p>
<p>The place was named in honour of George H. Weller,
    for some time Superintendent Engineer of the present
    Welland Canal. The one now under construction is, in
    the main, built on the original plan submitted by the
    brilliant engineer, Weller. He did not live to see his
    dream approach realization.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Prescott</span>: county in Ontario, erected in 1798; and a
    town in Grenville county, Ontario.</p>
<p>They were named in honour of Major-General Robert
    Prescott, 1725-1815, Governor-General of Canada, Nova
    Scotia and New Brunswick, 1796-&rsquo;99. Prescott listened
    to the settlers&rsquo; complaints and tried to befriend them.
    This brought down upon him the ill-will of Chief-Justice
    Osgoode and the Board of Management of the Crown
    Lands, the members of which had acquired under one
    pretext or another many of the best tracts of land in the
    country. These officials secured the Governor&rsquo;s recall,
    but the majority of the people held him in high esteem as
    an honourable and upright man.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Preston</span>: township in Nipissing district, Ontario,
    erected in 1889.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>
<p>It was named after Doctor Robert Henry Preston,
    M.P.P. for Leeds from 1875 to 1890.</p>
<p>Preston is also the name of a prosperous, picturesque
    town in Waterloo county, Ontario. It possesses mineral
    springs of much medicinal value.</p>
<p>It took its name from the town of Preston in Lancashire,
    England.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Prince Albert</span>: city in Saskatchewan.</p>
<p>It was named in 1866 after Prince Albert, husband of
    Queen Victoria, by Reverend James Nisbet who established
    a Presbyterian mission station at this place in that
    year.</p>
<p>Prince Albert is also the name of a National Park
    thirty miles north of the city of Prince Albert, set aside
    by the Dominion Government in 1927. It contains 1377
    square miles and is of great scenic beauty.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Prince Edward</span>: the island province of Canada; also a
    county of Ontario, organized in 1792.</p>
<p>Both were named in honour of Prince Edward
    Augustus, Duke of Kent, fourth son of King George III.,
    born 1767, died 1820. He was the father of our late
    illustrious Queen Victoria.</p>
<p>The Micmac Indian name of Prince Edward Island
    was Epagwit, meaning &ldquo;resting on the waves&rdquo;. The
    French name was Ile St. Jean, and the English name was
    St. John&rsquo;s Island until its present name was adopted in
    1800.</p>
<p>The French name of Prince Edward county was
    Presqu&rsquo;isle de Quinte, the almost island of Quinte.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Prince Rupert</span>: northern coast city of British
    Columbia.</p>
<p>It was the only Pacific terminus of the Grand Trunk
    Railway. The name was chosen in 1906 in open competi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>tion,
    the Grand Trunk Pacific Company offering a prize
    of $250 for the most suitable name. There were about
    1,200 names suggested. Miss Eleanor M. McDonald of
    Winnipeg offered Prince Rupert, Mrs. John Orme of
    Bonnechere and Mr. R. Kirkwood of Copper Cliff, Port
    Rupert. One condition was that the name should not
    contain more than three syllables and ten letters. The
    Company finally preferred Prince Rupert but in order to
    be fair awarded $250 to each of these three competitors.</p>
<p>Prince Rupert, 1619-&rsquo;82, was the son of Frederick V.,
    King of Bohemia and Elizabeth, daughter of James I. of
    England. He entered the military service of his Uncle
    Charles I. in 1642 and fought in the Civil War until the
    Royalist cause was lost in 1649. At the Restoration in
    1660, Rupert returned to England and was made Admiral
    of the fleet by Charles II. By virtue of Hudson&rsquo;s discoveries
    in 1610, King Charles II. claimed the northern territory
    of America, and in 1670 he granted a Charter to an
    English company to trade in furs in this region. Prince
    Rupert was the first governor of this Hudson&rsquo;s Bay
    Company.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Pringle</span>: township in Parry Sound district, erected in

<p><span class="bold">Quebec</span>: the oldest province of Canada, and its capital
    city, founded in 1608 by Champlain.</p>
<p>The word Quebec is Indian in its origin and all
    authorities agree that its meaning is narrows, contraction,
    obstruction&mdash;&ldquo;Where the river narrows&rdquo;. Here is the
    narrowest place in the whole course of the St. Lawrence.
    The term is common to the Algonquin, Cree and Micmac
    languages and signifies the same in each dialect.</p>
<p>Most of the early French authors spelled the word
    Kebec. Champlain wrote it Quebecq.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Queen Charlotte</span>: sound, channel, strait, and islands,
    Coast district, B.C.</p>

<p>The word is a corruption of the name of an Iroquois
    Indian village of former days, situated in the neighbourhood
    of Rice Lake and variously spelled by French
    geographers, Kentsio, Kentio, Quento. English geographers
    called Lac de Kentsio, Rice Lake, and taking a long

<p><span class="bold">Radcliffe</span>: township in Renfrew county, Ontario,
    formed in 1859.</p>
<p>The origin of the name is uncertain. It may have been
    named after Hon. Thomas Radcliffe, 1794-1841, who
    served under Wellington through the Peninsular Campaigns.
    He settled in Adelaide, Wellington county, in
    1832, and gave loyal service in 1837-&rsquo;38. Mr. Radcliffe
    became a member of the Legislative Council of Upper
    Canada.</p>
<p>Another Radcliffe in the public eye about this time was
    General Sir William Pollexfen Radcliffe, 1823-&rsquo;97, who
    gave distinguished military service in both India and the
    Crimea.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Raglan</span>: township in Renfrew county, Ontario, organized

    Wellington in the Peninsular War. He lost his right arm
    in the battle of Waterloo. Lord Raglan had command of
    the British army of invasion of the Crimea until his death
    from cholera June 28, 1855. On every field of action he
    valiantly defended the honour of the country&rsquo;s flag.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Rainham</span>: township in Haldimand county, Ontario,
    organized in 1792.</p>
<p>It took its name from Rainham village in Norfolk,
    England. At the time of its settlement this township
    formed part of Norfolk county.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Rainy</span>: lake and river, international boundary, Rainy
    River district, Ontario.</p>
<p>The river takes its name from the lake which the
    Indians called Tekamammaouen and the French Lac la
    Pluie, meaning &ldquo;It is raining all the time&rdquo;, referring to
    the spray from the Koochiching Falls at the outlet.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Raleigh</span>: township in Kent county, Ontario, surveyed
    in 1794.</p>
<p>The origin of the name is uncertain. In all probability
    it was named after Sir Walter Raleigh, 1552-1618, a
    versatile favourite of Queen Elizabeth. He achieved
    distinction as soldier, sailor, scholar, courtier, orator and
    historian.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Rama</span>: township in Ontario county, Ontario, organized
    in 1820.</p>
<p>Doubtless this name was suggested by Sir Peregrine
    Maitland, Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada 1818-1828,
    who had seen considerable military service in the
    Peninsular War. It is Spanish for &ldquo;the branch of a tree&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Rama is also found in the Bible;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
    <p>&ldquo;Thus saith the Lord: A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation,
        and bitter weeping; Rachel weeping for her children refused
        to be comforted for her children, because they were not&rdquo;. Jeremiah
        XXXI, 15.</p>
</div>
<p>Rama is the Greek form of Ramah of the Bible, which
    is said to mean &ldquo;a high place&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Ramsay</span>: township in Lanark county, Ontario, formed
    in 1823.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of a British officer of distinction
    at this time, General George Ramsay, 1770-1838.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Rawdon</span>: township in Hastings county, Ontario,
    erected in 1798.</p>
<p>It took its name from Francis Rawdon Hastings, 1754-1826,
    who gave many years of military and civil service
    to the Crown in George III.&rsquo;s reign. See <i>Hastings county</i>.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Reach</span>: township in Ontario county, Ontario, organized
    in 1809.</p>
<p>It took its name from the village of Reach in Bedfordshire,
    England.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Regina</span>: the capital of Saskatchewan.</p>
<p>Regina is the Latin word for Queen. The name was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span> suggested in 1882 by the Princess Louise, wife of the
    Governor-General, Lord Lorne, who had been appealed to
    for a more attractive name than Pile of Bones when
    Lieutenant-Governor Dewdney selected the spot where the
    C.P.R. crossed Pile of Bones Creek as the site for a new
    seat of government. The name of Waskana, Sioux Indian
    for Pile of Bones, was suggested by Sir Sam Steele of the
    North West Mounted Police. In the early days heaps of
    buffalo bones lay along the edge of the creek.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Renfrew</span>: the largest county in Ontario, bordering for
    many miles on the Ottawa River.</p>
<p>It took its name from Renfrewshire, Scotland. The
    original home of the Stuarts was in the parish of
    Renfrew. This fact accounts for one of the titles of the
    Prince of Wales, Baron Renfrew. George I. was the grandson
    of Princess Elizabeth, daughter of James I. of the
    Stuart line.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Restigouche</span>: county and river in New Brunswick, the
    county taking its name from the river. There are two
    spellings, English map-makers give Restigouche, French,
    Ristigouche. There are also three significations of this
    word.</p>
<p>The Rev. Ph. F. Bourgeois derives it from the Micmac, <i>Lust-a-gooch</i>, meaning &ldquo;river with five branches&rdquo;, or
    &ldquo;river of numerous branches spread out like the fingers
    of the hand&rdquo;.</p>
<p>R. F. Pacifique traces it to the Micmac word, <i>Listogotig</i>,
    meaning &ldquo;the scene of the great quarrel about the
    squirrel&rdquo;. Tradition relates that many years ago the
    Micmacs met the Mohawks here in council. When their
    children were playing they caught a white squirrel and
    quarreled about its possession. Their parents took up the
    quarrel and the Micmacs fought the Mohawks along the
    banks of this river for forty years.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>
<p>Rev. Dr. S. T. Rand states Restigouche is a corruption
    of the Micmac word <i>lustegooch</i>, meaning &ldquo;dead, decaying
    trees&rdquo;.</p>
<p>W. F. Ganong, an eminent authority, states the meaning
    is uncertain, but that Restigouche and Miramichi are
    derived from Micmac synonyms, and, therefore, the meaning
    must be some peculiarity in common; such as, &ldquo;with
    numerous branches&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Revelstoke</span>: city in B.C.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Lord Revelstoke, head of
    the British banking firm of Baring Bros. He bought
    $15,000,000 of the first bond issue of the C.P.R. The
    city was founded in 1886.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Reversing</span>: falls St. John River, St. John county, New
    Brunswick. There are two falls during every tide, one
    outward and one inward. The scene is unique and visited
    by all tourists of the Province.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Rice</span>: lake lying between the counties of Northumberland
    and Peterborough, Ontario.</p>
<p>It was so called because on its reedy water-fields, wild
    rice flourishes.</p>
<p>This plant is known by many names. The French
    called it <i>riz du Canada</i>. The English called it Canadian
    rice, wild rice, wild oats and Indian rice. The Indians
    used a derivative of the Algonquin word <i>manomin</i> meaning
    &ldquo;good berry&rdquo;. It abounds in many waters of Canada
    and northern U.S.</p>
<p>Mrs. Thraill thus describes the plant in June: &ldquo;It has
    a beautiful appearance, with its broad grassy leaves and
    light waving spikes garnished with pale yellow-green
    blossoms delicately shaded with reddish purple, from
    beneath which fall three straw-coloured anthers, which
    move with every breath of air or slightest motion of the
    water.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>
<p>Wild fowl fatten on Canadian rice and the Indians
    considered it fully as nourishing as maize or wheat. The
    squaws collected it when ripe by poling their canoes into
    the rice fields and, reaching out, drew over the heads and
    beat the grain into the canoe.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Richards</span>: township in Renfrew county, Ontario,
    erected in 1862.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Chief-Justice Sir William
    Buell Richards, 1815-&rsquo;89. His family was of U.E. Loyalist
    descent, having settled in Brockville in 1785. Mr.
    Richards studied law, was called to the bar in 1837, and
    elected member of Parliament for Leeds county in 1848.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Richebucto</span>: head, town and river, eastern New
    Brunswick.</p>
<p>The word is Micmac Indian but its meaning is uncertain.</p>
<p>Father Guay states it is a corruption of <i>Lichibouktouck</i>,
    meaning &ldquo;river which enters the woods&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Cooney derives the word from <i>Booktaoo</i>, meaning
    &ldquo;fire&rdquo;. See <i>Pictou</i>.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Richmond</span>: township in Lennox county, Ontario,
    organized in 1786.</p>
<p>It took its name from Charles Lennox, third Duke of
    Richmond. The title was taken from the town of Richmond
    in Yorkshire. See <i>Lennox</i>.</p>
<p>The villages of Richmond in Carleton county, and
    Richmond Hill in York county, Ontario, are named after
    the fourth Duke of Richmond, Governor-General of
    Canada, 1818-&rsquo;19, so also the county and town of Richmond,
    Quebec.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Rideau</span>: river in Ontario, an affluent of the Ottawa,
    a lake expansion of the river, a canal connecting
    Kingston with Ottawa by way of the river and lake, and
    a falls on the river in the vicinity of Ottawa.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>
<p>Rideau is a French word meaning &ldquo;a curtain, a
    screen&rdquo;, descriptive of the appearance of the Falls to
    which the word was first applied. The Governor-General&rsquo;s
    residence at Ottawa is called Rideau Hall.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Ridgetown</span>: picturesque and enterprising town in
    Kent county, Ontario. It was incorporated as a village
    in 1876 and as a town in 1882.</p>
<p>The first settlers taking up the four farms that afterwards
    became incorporated in the town were, William
    Marsh, James Watson, Edmund Mitton, and Ebenezer
    Colby. Mr. Marsh came in 1822, and the others in 1823.</p>
<p>The town was named from its location on the summit
    of the ridge or watershed dividing the water flowing to
    the River Thames on the north and to Lake Erie on the
    south. The honour of giving the name was bestowed by
    the settlers on James Watson, who furnished the lot for
    the first school-house which was built in 1830 at a corner
    that is now the centre of the town.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Ridout</span>: township in Muskoka district, Ontario, organized
    in 1862.</p>
<p>It is named in honour of a well-known Toronto family
    of a former generation, of which Thomas Ridout was the
    founder. Mr. Ridout was an Englishman by birth from
    Sherbourne, Dorsetshire. He settled with his family in
    York, now Toronto, in 1797. Mr. Ridout became Surveyor-General
    of Upper Canada, Registrar of York county,
    and member of the Legislative Council.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Rimouski</span>: county in Quebec, and also its chief town.</p>
<p>All authorities agree the word is Malecite or Micmac
    and means &ldquo;the home or retreat of dogs&rdquo;, in allusion
    perhaps to its fine hunting grounds.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Rivière du Loup</span>: city in Temiscouata county, Quebec.</p>
<p>It derived its name from the river there so called on
    a map of 1685. <i>Loup</i> is the French word for wolf. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span> was the river of the wolves or Mahingan Indians. The
    name may have been suggested by, the ferocity of the
    animals, or by the warlike disposition of the Indians that
    inhabited this region, or by both.</p>
<p>There is also a Rivière du Loup in Maskinonge county,
    Quebec.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Robinson</span>: township in Manitoulin district, Ontario,
    erected in 1879.</p>
<p>It took its name from a member of a distinguished
    Toronto family, probably Hon. John Beverley Robinson,
    1821-&rsquo;96, son of Chief-Justice Sir J. B. Robinson. Mr.
    Robinson was Lieutenant-Governor of Ontario from 1880
    to 1887.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Rochester</span>: township in Essex county, Ontario, organized
    in 1792.</p>
<p>It took its name from an ancient Roman station or
    camp (now a city) in Kent county, England. The English
    city has a famous castle built by Bishop Gundolph in
    the eleventh century. It is still in a fair state of preservation.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Rocky</span>: mountains in Alberta and B.C.</p>
<p>The earliest recorded reference to these mountains is
    found in the diary of 1716 of James Knight, who was
    governor of York Factory. Indians from this part of the
    country told him it was very mountainous and of a
    prodigious height.</p>
<p>In 1730 Beauharnois the French Governor transmitted
    to France a sketch drawn for La Vérendrye by
    the Indian Ochagach on which is indicated the &ldquo;Montagnes
    de Pierres Brillantes&rdquo; or &ldquo;Mountains of Bright
    Stones&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Legardeur St.-Pierre&rsquo;s Journal of 1752 refers to them
    by their present name &ldquo;Montagnes de Roche&rdquo;, which in
    Cree Indian is <i>assinwati</i>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Rogers</span>: glacier, pass and peak, Selkirk mountains,
    Kootenay district, British Columbia.</p>
<p>They were named after Albert B. Rogers (1829-1889)
    who, in 1883 explored the pass that bears his name and
    by which the Canadian Pacific Railway crosses the
    Selkirks.</p>
<p>When Van Horne took hold of the C.P.R. in 1882, its
    charter provided for the line to be built through the Yellowhead
    Pass, but the route was changed to go to Fort
    Calgary even though no pass through the Selkirks was
    known. Rogers and a companion named Carroll were
    sent to search for one. After months of incredible hardships
    the pass was found which is forever associated with
    his name.</p>
<p>Rogers was a graduate of high standing of Yale, a
    lover and liver of the wild. The C.P.R. acknowledged his
    great service by a cheque for $5,000. He did not cash
    it but had the check framed and hung in his brother&rsquo;s
    home in Minnesota. When Van Horne reminded him a
    year later that he had not cashed the check, Rogers said
    he was not in the game for money.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Rolph</span>: township in Renfrew county, Ontario, organized
    in 1855.</p>
<p>It was named after Hon. John Rolph, M.D., 1793-1870.
    He was opposed to the Family Compact and secretly
    associated with William Lyon Mackenzie. On the outbreak
    of the Rebellion Rolph fled to the United States,
    but was pardoned and returned to Canada in 1843. After
    his return he was elected to Parliament. In 1853 Dr.
    Rolph founded the Toronto School of Medicine.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Romney</span>: township in Kent county, Ontario, formed in
    1794.</p>
<p>It was named after a small town and Cinque Port in
    Kent county, England.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Rondeau</span>: village in Kent county, Ontario. Rondeau
    Harbour is a village and port on Lake Erie in the same
    county.</p>
<p>Rondeau is derived from the French <i>rond</i>, &ldquo;circular&rdquo;
    and <i>eau</i>, &ldquo;water&rdquo;. The name is descriptive of the shape
    of the harbour.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Ross</span>: township in Renfrew county, Ontario, organized
    in 1830.</p>
<p>It took its name, doubtless, from Ross county, Scotland,
    having been settled largely by Highlanders from
    that county. The name of Sir James Clark Ross, 1800-1862,
    a British navigator and Arctic discoverer, has been
    associated sometimes with the naming of this township.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Rouyn</span>: canton in Temiscaming county, Quebec,
    erected in 1916; and a lake and mining town in the
    district.</p>
<p>They were named in memory of Captain de Rouyn of
    a famous French regiment that gave distinguished service
    to New France.</p>
<p>Some three years ago gold was discovered in Rouyn
    and later rich copper mines. Copper is now counted as
    the wealth of the Rouyn belt with enough gold to pay for
    mining and reducing the ore. The town of Rouyn has
    now (1927) a population of over 4,000 and is provided
    with all modern civic conveniences.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Roxborough</span>: township in Stormont county, Ontario,
    formed in 1798.</p>
<p>It was named after Roxburghshire, a border county of
    Scotland. Some writers state the selection of this name
    was due to King George III.&rsquo;s friendship for the Right
    Hon. John Ker, third Duke of Roxburgh.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Runnymede</span>: district, avenue, and public school in
    the western part of the city of Toronto.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>
<p>It took its name from Runnymede (a park, island,
    and district) in Buckinghamshire, England. It was here
    on June 15, 1215, that King John signed Magna Charta or
    the Great Charter of English liberties or rights presented
    by Archbishop Stephen Langton, leader of the people in
    their protest against the unjust exactions of the King.</p>
<p>This word is found in literature in three spellings;
    Runnymede, Runnimede, and Runemede. At the railway
    station in England the writer saw &ldquo;Runemede&rdquo; and this
    spelling indicates most clearly the origin of this interesting
    word. It was the &ldquo;meadow of the runes&rdquo;, that is the
    ancient Anglo-Saxon field of council. Here they met for
    the purpose of legislation.</p>
<p>Rune is one of the characters of the earliest alphabet
    of the Teutonic nations. In the plural it was often used
    to represent these people or their language.</p>
<p>While Runnymede Park has been government land for
    many years, the historic island and immediate environs
    have been private property until very recently (1929)
    when they were presented to the British nation by Lady
    Fairhaven. All hail the public-spirited Lady and her
    ever-memorable gift.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Russell</span>: county in Ontario and township in the county,
    both organized in 1798.</p>
<p>They were called after Hon. Peter Russell who came
    to Canada with Lieutenant-Governor Simcoe. From
    Simcoe&rsquo;s departure in 1796 until the arrival of General
    Hunter in 1799 Mr. Russell was President or Administrator
    of the Government of Upper Canada. History accords
    him many virtues and but one vice, a too excessive desire
    to acquire public lands for himself and friends. (See Dr.
    Scadding&rsquo;s <i>Toronto of Old</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="bold">Ryde</span>: township in Muskoka district, Ontario, formed
    in 1861.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>
<p>It took its name from the town of Ryde in the Isle of
    Wight. Ryde is nearly opposite to Spithead, a favourite
    area for naval reviews. The town is picturesque in situation
    and a charming watering-place.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Ryerson</span>: township in Parry Sound district, surveyed
    in 1870.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Rev. Egerton Ryerson,
    D.D., LL.D., 1803-&rsquo;82. His father Colonel Joseph Ryerson
    was a U.E. Loyalist. In 1825 Egerton Ryerson became
    a Methodist minister; in 1829 he was appointed editor of
    the <i>Christian Guardian</i>, which was merged into the <i>New
    Outlook</i> in 1925; in 1841 he was chosen President of
    Victoria College, then at Cobourg, and in 1844 he was
    appointed Chief Superintendent of Education for Upper
    Canada, retiring in 1876 on full salary. Dr. Ryerson is
    regarded as the founder of Ontario&rsquo;s public school system.</p>

<h2><a name="S" id="S">S</a></h2>
<p><span class="bold">Sabine</span>: township in Nipissing district, Ontario,
    organized in 1872.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of General Sir Edward
    Sabine, 1786-1883, distinguished as soldier and scientist.
    He took part in the War of 1812-&rsquo;14 in Canada.
    Afterwards he made a series of voyages from the equator
    to the Arctic circle to determine the requisite length of
    the pendulum to beat seconds in different latitudes, and
    thus laid the basis for an accurate determination of the
    shape of the earth. His discoveries led to the establishment
    of magnetic observatories in Britain and the overseas
    Dominions.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Sables</span>: Rivière aux Sables, river in Ontario, emptying
    into Lake Huron.</p>
<p>This name was given by the early French settlers.
    The phrase means &ldquo;River of Sands&rdquo; or &ldquo;Sand river&rdquo;, in
    allusion to its sandy banks and bottom. The French
    phrase is sometimes corrupted into &ldquo;Ausable River&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Sackville</span>: seaport town of New Brunswick, and
    village in Halifax county, Nova Scotia. Sackville, N.B.,
    is the seat of Mount Allison University, founded in 1843
    by Charles F. Allison.</p>
<p>Both places were named in honour of Lord Sackville
    who was made Commander of the British Forces in 1758.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Saguenay</span>: county in Quebec and large affluent of the
    St. Lawrence.</p>
<p>The county took its name from the river. The origin
    of the word is disputed. Lafleche derives it from the Cree
    Indian, <i>sake</i>, &ldquo;to emerge&rdquo;, and <i>nipi</i>, &ldquo;water&rdquo;, that is,
    &ldquo;water which emerges&rdquo; (from between high rocks).
    Arnaud derives it from the French and states it means
    &ldquo;ice pierced or perforated&rdquo;, describing the effect of the
    Saguenay at its mouth on the ice-bound St. Lawrence.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="bold">St. Andrews</span>: town in Charlotte county, New
    Brunswick.</p>
<p>It takes its name from Scotland&rsquo;s patron saint. The
    town is picturesquely situated and is a favourite watering-place.</p>
<p>Andrew was one of the twelve Apostles of our Lord.
    He was crucified in A.D. 60 by order of the Emperor Nero
    on a decussate cross (divided crosswise in the form of an
    X) to which he was bound not nailed, to prolong his sufferings.
    This cross is now called St. Andrew&rsquo;s. His commemoration
    feast day is November 30th.</p>
<p>There is a tradition that a French priest erected a
    cross on the site of this town and celebrated Mass here for
    the first time on November 30th, hence the name.</p>
<p><span class="bold">St. Anne de Beaupré</span>: the village of St. Anne of the
    beautiful meadow land is situated on the north shore of
    the St. Lawrence, Montmorency county, Quebec.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Anne who, according to
    tradition, was the mother of the Virgin Mary, was born
    in Bethlehem and became the wife of Joachim. A church
    was built in her honour in Constantinople by Justinian
    in 550 but it was not till 1584 that the observation of her
    festival (July 26) was enjoined on Roman Catholics. St.
    Anne is the special patroness of women in child-birth and
    of minors.</p>
<p>On the high rock ridge behind Percé village, Gaspé, is
    erected a magnificent gilded statue of the Saint. The
    fishermen off this coast generally carry a small flag at
    the bow of their boats, on which is inscribed, &ldquo;St. Anne
    protects us.&rdquo; If a storm should arise they cease work,
    fall on their knees in the boats and pray for protection
    to the good Patroness of their wives and families.</p>
<p>The church of St. Anne de Beaupré is a shrine visited
    by thousands each year and many cures are reported to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span> have been effected there. The origin of the church was a
    &ldquo;great peril to which certain Breton fishermen were
    exposed in a tempest in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, about
    the beginning of the 17th century. They made a vow to
    erect, if they escaped, a chapel to good St. Anne on the
    spot where they should land. Heaven heard their prayers
    and they kept their word.&rdquo; (Life of Laval, Makers of
    Canada Series.) In 1878 a magnificent edifice was
    erected on, or near the original site.</p>
<p><span class="bold">St. Anne de Bellevue</span>: picturesque village in Jacques
    Cartier county, Quebec.</p>
<p>It was here that the Irish poet, Thomas Moore, wrote
    his melodious poem, &ldquo;A Canadian Boat-Song&rdquo;. The house
    in which he was entertained on his visit in 1804 still
    stands. It is a fine old gray stone structure now used as
    a bank. Macdonald College, devoted to agriculture and
    horticulture, is situated in close proximity to the village.</p>
<p>The name was given in honour of the Saint revered by
    all French-Canadians. See <i>St. Anne de Beaupré</i>.</p>
<p><span class="bold">St. Boniface</span>: city in Manitoba, situated on the Red
    River, opposite the city of Winnipeg.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of St. Boniface, a Christian
    missionary, born at Crediton, England, in 680 and killed
    by a pagan mob in Friesland, Germany, in 755. He converted
    most of the heathen people of Germany and baptized
    them into the Church of Rome. In 732 the Pope
    appointed him Archbishop of all Germany. In 1926 a
    baptismal font into which St. Boniface is believed to have
    immersed his converts was found in the ruins of a chapel
    in Hesse.</p>
<p>The name was translated to Canada by Abbé (later
    Bishop) Provencher in 1818 who placed his little chapel
    on the Red River &ldquo;under the patronage of St. Boniface
    to draw God&rsquo;s blessing on the Swiss-German Roman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span> Catholic settlers of his parish.&rdquo; The settlement soon
    became known as St. Boniface.</p>
<p><span class="bold">St. Catharines</span>: city in the county of Lincoln, Ontario,
    commonly called &ldquo;the Garden City&rdquo;, owing to its early
    and beautiful flowers and foliage.</p>
<p>It was named in 1809 in honour of Mrs. Catharine
    Hamilton, wife of Hon. Robert Hamilton. See <i>Hamilton</i>.</p>
<p>The early name of the settlement was &ldquo;Shipman&rsquo;s
    Corners&rdquo; after Paul Shipman who had a tavern here at
    the beginning of the nineteenth century. St. Paul Street
    perpetuates his name.</p>
<p><span class="bold">St. Clair</span>: lake and river in Ontario.</p>
<p>On the twelfth of August, 1679, La Salle, with his
    pioneer merchantman, the <i>Griffin</i>, entered this lake. It
    was the day dedicated to Sancta Clara, in French Sainte
    Claire, in English Saint Clair, hence our name. Clara of
    Assisi was a charming maiden who became the Abbess of
    San Damiano and foundress of the Order of the Poor
    Clares. She died in 1253 and the festival is held on the
    anniversary of her burial.</p>
<p><span class="bold">St. Croix</span>: river, village and island (now Dochet
    Island in Maine politically) in south-western New Brunswick.</p>
<p>The river and village took their name from the island,
    so named by De Monts, companion of Champlain, in 1604.
    The cross formed by two streams coming into the main
    one above the island suggested the name, Sainte Croix,
    &ldquo;Holy Cross&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">St. David</span>: village in Niagara township, Lincoln
    county, Ontario.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Major David Secord who
    commanded the Second Lincoln Militia in the Battle of
    Chippewa, July 5, 1814. David Thompson in his history
    of the war states that Secord&rsquo;s Militia distinguished them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>selves
    in this action by feats of genuine bravery and
    heroism, stimulated by the example of their gallant leader.
    The Secords were of Huguenot and U.E. Loyalist descent.</p>
<p><span class="bold">St. Hyacinthe</span>: county in Quebec, and its chief town.</p>
<p>The Governor of New France granted this seigniory
    to P. T. de Rigaud in 1748. He sold it in 1753 to
    Hyacinthe Simon Delorme, from one of whose Christian
    names the word is derived.</p>
<p><span class="bold">St. Jacobs</span>: village in Waterloo county, Ontario.</p>
<p>Its foundation was laid in 1848 by one Solomon
    Bauman who built a saw mill in that year on the Conestoga
    River. This mill was purchased in 1850 by Jacob C.
    Snider, Sr., who built a large brick grist mill in 1851.
    The village was then named after Jacob C. Snider, Sr.,
    as St. Jacobs. Information received from W. H. Winkler,
    Postmaster.</p>
<p><span class="bold">St. John</span>: river in New Brunswick, and the chief city
    of the province.</p>
<p>The city takes its name from the river which was discovered
    by Champlain on St. Jean Baptiste&rsquo;s day, June
    24, 1604, and by him named St. Jean or St. John in honour
    of the Saint. It has borne this name ever since.</p>
<p>The city was founded by U.E. Loyalists in 1783 under
    the name of Parr Town in honour of the Governor,
    Colonel Parr. Incorporated in 1785 under the name St.
    John it is the oldest incorporated city in Canada.</p>
<p>St. Johns is the name of a county and its county-town
    in south-western Quebec.</p>
<p><span class="bold">St. Joseph</span>: or St. Joseph&rsquo;s; an island nineteen miles
    long in the channel between Lake Huron and Lake
    Superior. It contains the historic ruins of a British fort
    now somewhat preserved by the Federal Government.</p>
<p>St. Joseph is also the name of a village in Huron
    county, Ontario, and of several villages in Quebec.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>
<p>They were all named, doubtless, in honour of Joseph,
    the husband of Mary, the Mother of Christ. The Recollets
    or Recollects, the first French missionaries to the
    Indians (1615), chose St. Joseph for the patron saint of
    the new Indian church they sought to establish in Canada.
    The Jesuit Fathers who came later to aid them, seem to
    have acquiesced in their choice. St. Jean Baptiste is the
    patron saint of the Canadien church.</p>
<p><span class="bold">St. Lawrence</span>: magnificent river, outlet of the Great
    Lakes into the Atlantic Ocean through the Gulf of St.
    Lawrence. Its immediate source is in Lake Ontario, its
    ultimate source in the St. Louis River which rises in
    northern Minnesota and flows into Lake Superior. The
    St. Lawrence River alone from Lake Ontario to the Gulf
    is 750 miles. This immense chain of lakes and rivers
    is Canada&rsquo;s water highway of commerce.</p>
<p>On his second voyage in 1535 Cartier sailed into a little
    bay on the north shore of the Gulf on the 10th of August.
    This is the feast day of St. Lawrence, so he named the
    bay after him. Later the name spread to the whole Gulf
    and River.</p>
<p>Saint Lawrence was a venerated deacon of the Roman
    Church, put to death August 10, 258, by order of Emperor
    Valerian. When asked to hand over the treasure of the
    church he brought forward the poor among whom he had
    divided the church&rsquo;s income. The burial place of this celebrated
    martyr is in the Catacomb of Cyriaca. He is said
    to have been roasted to death on a gridiron. In the
    library of Lambeth Palace, England, there is an illuminated
    representation (exquisite piece of art) of the Saint
    with a gridiron in his right hand, and a painting of his
    ordination as deacon by Sixtus II., done by Angelious, in
    the Vatican.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="bold">St. Lin</span>: pleasant town in the county of L&rsquo;Assomption,
    Quebec. It was here that Sir Wilfrid Laurier, Premier
    of Canada for fifteen years (1896-1911), was born, and
    here and at L&rsquo;Assomption College he passed his school
    days.</p>
<p>St. Lin is named in honour of St. Linus, the immediate
    successor of St. Peter in the see of Rome. Tradition says
    he lies buried near the &ldquo;Prince of the Apostles&rdquo; in St.
    Peter&rsquo;s. He is generally conceded to be the Linus mentioned
    in 2 Timothy (IV-21).</p>
<p><span class="bold">St. Marys</span>: charming town in Perth county, Ontario.</p>
<p>It took its name from the wife of Commissioner
    Thomas Mercer Jones of the Canada Company.</p>
<p><i>Picturesque Canada</i> gives the origin of the name as
    follows: &ldquo;Met together to christen &lsquo;The Falls&rsquo; as the
    locality was named from the Thames rushing over a succession
    of rapids at this point, the wife of the Commissioner
    of the Canada Company, being present, suggested
    her own as a good name in default of a better, and
    at the same time offered £10 towards the construction of
    a much needed school-house. The suggestion was
    accepted and so were the ten pounds. Mrs. Mary Jones
    was canonized on the spot and from that day, the place
    was known as St. Marys. But the Commissioner himself
    had a frugal mind. The people built their school-house
    at a total cost of £100 and applied for the bonus of 10 per
    cent. offered by the Company for all such public improvements,
    when the Company, through the Commissioner,
    reminded them that they had already received £10, exactly
    the 10 per cent. contemplated!&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="bold">St. Ours</span> (pronounced oors): seigneury and town in
    Richelieu county, Quebec.</p>
<p>They took their name from Captain Pierre de Saint
    Ours who was granted a district here in 1672 by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span> French government. He had been an officer in the famous
    Carignan-Salières Regiment which arrived in Canada in
    1665, the first force of regulars sent to America by the
    French. The Regiment had been raised by Prince de
    Carignan and was under the command of Henri de
    Chapelas, Sieur de Salières, hence its name. Many of the
    soldiers on receiving their discharge became settlers.</p>
<p>St. Ours is also an island (named after the same Captain,
    part of whose seigneury it was), in the St. Lawrence
    River, opposite the parish of Contrec&#339;ur in Verchères
    county. This parish or seigneury is also named
    after a Captain in the Carignan Regiment.</p>
<p><span class="bold">St. Stephen</span>: town in New Brunswick. The name was
    suggested no doubt by the names of other saints so
    honoured in the vicinity.</p>
<p>Stephen was one of the first deacons and the first
    Christian martyr. See the Bible, Acts vi and vii. His
    feast of commemoration is held on December 26th.</p>
<p><span class="bold">St. Thomas</span>: city in Elgin county, Ontario.</p>
<p>The name commemorates Colonel Thomas Talbot,
    1771-1853. It is in the very heart of what is known as the
    &ldquo;Talbot country&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Young Talbot was a member of Lieut.-Governor
    Simcoe&rsquo;s staff, 1791-&rsquo;96. Colonel Talbot returned to Upper
    Canada in 1803 with the title to a grant of 5,000 acres
    in his pocket, secured through Simcoe&rsquo;s influence. He
    became a great colonizer, giving his settlers fifty acres
    free on performing certain settlement duties. Talbot and
    Wellington had been school boys together and through the
    great Duke&rsquo;s influence the Colonel&rsquo;s original grant is said
    to have grown in half a century to 700,000 acres. The
    two friends died in the same year, Talbot three months
    after Wellington. He is said never to have broken his
    word to a settler and to have created thousands of happy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span> firesides, though some thought him exacting and unfair.
    This civil and military saint sleeps among his old settlers
    in a little churchyard at Port Talbot.</p>
<p><span class="bold">St. Vincent</span>: township in Grey county, Ontario, surveyed
    in 1840.</p>
<p>It took its name from John Jervis, Earl of St. Vincent,
    1734-1823. He went to sea when he was ten years of age
    and gradually rose to be captain in the naval service.
    His command defeated the Spanish fleet at Cadiz in 1797.
    For this he was raised to the peerage, awarded a gold
    medal and granted a pension of £3,000 per annum. The
    title appears to have been taken from Cape St. Vincent
    in Portugal, near where the Battle of Cadiz was fought.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Saltfleet</span>: township in Lincoln county, Ontario, organized
    in 1792.</p>
<p>It was named after Saltfleet, a seaport town in Lincolnshire,
    England.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Sandfield</span>: township in Manitoulin district, surveyed
    in 1870.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Hon. John Sandfield Macdonald,
    1812-&rsquo;72. He was a lawyer by profession, entered
    Parliament in 1841, and became Premier of Canada in
    1862, Mr. Macdonald opposed Confederation in 1867, but
    became the first Premier of Ontario. Though a Roman
    Catholic he was opposed to Separate Schools. His government
    was efficient and economical, but was defeated in
    1871. In his memory a fine statue was erected by the
    Provincial Government in Queen&rsquo;s Park, Toronto.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Sandwich</span>: county-town of Essex county: and two
    townships, East and West Sandwich, in the same county.</p>
<p>They took their name from Sandwich, a borough and
    Cinque Port in Kent county, England. The word is
    derived from sand and <i>wick</i> or <i>wich</i>, found in both Anglo-Saxon
    and Norse names. <i>Wich</i> means a station, with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span> Saxons a station or village on land, with the Norse it was
    a station for ships.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Sarawak</span>: township in Grey county, organized in
    1855.</p>
<p>It took its name from Sarawak in the island of Borneo.
    In 1841 the Sultan or Chief of Borneo ceded a part of the
    island, including the town of Sarawak, to Sir James
    Brooke, a British naval officer, who suppressed piracy in
    that quarter.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Sarnia</span>: the county-town of Lambton county, Ontario,
    and township in that county, instituted in 1835. Sarnia
    is the name the Romans gave to the island we call
    Guernsey. Sir John Colborne had been Governor of
    Guernsey before he was appointed Lieut.-Governor of
    Upper Canada. In 1835 Sir John visited this district and
    was asked to give a name for the new settlement. He suggested
    the old Roman or Latin name for the Channel
    Island from which he had recently come. Sarnia was
    incorporated as a city in 1914.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Saskatchewan</span>: was erected into a province of Canada
    in 1905 by the Dominion Government.</p>
<p>It took its name from the Saskatchewan River which
    flows through the central part of the province into Lake
    Winnipeg. The word is derived from Cree Indian, <i>kishiska</i>, &ldquo;rapid&rdquo;, and <i>djiwan</i>, &ldquo;current&rdquo;, the river with
    the &ldquo;swift current&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Saskatoon</span>: city in Saskatchewan.</p>
<p>The site was selected and named in 1882 by John N.
    Lake of Toronto, acting for the Temperance Colonization
    Society of Toronto who had bought from the Government
    100,000 acres here for $200,000. Saskatoon was the name
    of a red berry found growing wild in this district. It was
    used in making buffalo pemmican.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Saugeen</span>: river flowing into Lake Huron, Bruce and
    Grey counties, Ontario, and also a township in Bruce
    county, erected in 1850.</p>
<p>The township took its name from the river. Saugeen
    is a Huron Indian word meaning &ldquo;river mouth&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Sault Ste. Marie</span>: river connecting Lake Superior
    with Lake Huron, and also a city situated on the river,
    district of Algoma, Ontario.</p>
<p>The city, incorporated in 1918, takes its name from the
    cataract on the river, the Sault Ste. Marie or Falls of St.
    Mary, so called by Jesuit missionaries. Ste. Marie is
    French for Mary, the Mother of Christ. <i>Sault</i> is old
    French for <i>saut</i>, modern French, meaning &ldquo;a leap&rdquo;. <i>Sault</i> is pronounced s&#333;, commonly sö.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Scarborough</span>: post village in York county, Ontario,
    organized in 1792.</p>
<p>It took its name from the town of Scarborough on
    the North Sea, Yorkshire, England. Near the town are
    huge craggy cliffs similar to those of Canada&rsquo;s Scarborough
    bordering on Lake Ontario.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Schomberg</span>: post village in York county, Ontario.</p>
<p>It was named after the Duke of Schomberg, an exiled
    Huguenot general, who followed William of Orange to
    England in 1688. He was killed in the Battle of the
    Boyne in 1690.</p>
<p>Huguenot is a term applied to the Protestants of
    France during the Reformation and in the religious
    struggles of the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries. Persecution
    by the Government drove them into political as
    well as religious unity. For many years war was waged
    between Catholics and Protestants. Thousands of Huguenots
    sought new homes in Germany, Switzerland, Holland,
    England and the United States. They were the most
    industrious, intelligent and moral people of France. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span> Protestants attained equality in political and civil rights
    with the Revolution of 1789.</p>
<p>Huguenot is a double diminutive of the French surname
    Huges (Hugh). It was a common name before the
    Reformation. Some derive the word from Hugo.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Schreiber</span>: village on C.P.R. in Thunder Bay district,
    Ontario.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Sir Collingwood Schreiber,
    civil engineer, Dominion public service. Mr. Schreiber
    was the son of Rev. Thomas Schreiber of Essex, England.
    He was born in 1831, educated in England, and came to
    Canada in 1852, entering immediately railway engineering
    service in this country. In 1880 Mr. Schreiber succeeded
    Sir Sandford Fleming as chief engineer of the
    C.P.R. In 1892 he was appointed chief engineer of the
    Department of Railways and Canals and Deputy Minister
    of Railways and Canals, Federal Government. Mr.
    Schreiber was a man of great ability and an authority on
    railways. He died in 1918.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Scott</span>: township in Ontario county, Ontario, instituted
    in 1820.</p>
<p>The origin of the name is uncertain. Some think it
    was named after Colonel Hercules Scott of the British
    Army, who was killed at Fort Erie in 1812. Others are
    of the opinion that it was called after Thomas Scott who
    was Chief-Justice of Upper Canada from 1806 to 1816.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Scubenacadie</span>: river in central Nova Scotia, flowing
    north into Cobequid Bay, and a village situated on the
    river in Hants county.</p>
<p>The word is Micmac Indian derived from <i>segubun</i>,
    &ldquo;ground nut&rdquo; and <i>akade</i>, &ldquo;place of&rdquo;, the place where the
    native potato or ground nut grew abundantly.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Scugog</span>: lake in central Ontario, and also a township
    in Ontario county, Ontario, erected in 1831.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>
<p>Scugog is a Huron Indian term meaning &ldquo;submerged
    or flooded land&rdquo; according to W. H. Smith&rsquo;s <i>History of
    Upper Canada</i> of date 1851. He states that a large part
    of this lake was artificially made. The formation of a
    mill-dam at Lindsay, many years ago, raised the water
    and forced it back over the land, thus flooding a large
    extent of country.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Seaforth</span>: town in Huron county, Ontario.</p>
<p>It took its name from Seaforth, an arm of the sea in
    the Hebrides, which partially divides Lewis from Harris.
    It is derived from <i>sea</i> and Gallic <i>frock</i>, by transposition
    and softening &ldquo;forth&rdquo;, meaning &ldquo;an arm or inlet&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Sebastopol</span>: township in Renfrew county, Ontario,
    organized in 1857.</p>
<p>In the Crimean War of 1854-&rsquo;56 Sebastopol, a fortified
    city of Russia, was taken after a long siege by the allied
    British, French and Turkish armies on September 8, 1855.
    The township was named Sebastopol to commemorate this
    victory.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Seine</span>: an affluent of the Red River in south-eastern
    Manitoba.</p>
<p>It took its name, doubtless, from the Seine in France.
    The word is derived from <i>sein</i>, &ldquo;a fishing-net&rdquo;, fishing
    being this river&rsquo;s chief contribution to man&rsquo;s welfare in
    early times. This is an instance of a common name or
    noun passing over to a proper one, another example of
    the native psychology of the human race in its infancy.
    Names were descriptive of some utility or characteristic
    of the thing named.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Selkirk</span>: town and settlement in Manitoba.</p>
<p>It took its name from Lord Selkirk who founded or
    attempted to found a colony here in the early years of the
    nineteenth century. His name is also commemorated in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span> a mountain range and peak in British Columbia and in
    several minor places in Canada.</p>
<p>Selkirk was a member of the Douglas family and his
    patriotic feelings were aroused by the condition of the
    humbler classes of the Highlands. His remedy was emigration.
    He bought £40,000 of the £100,000 stock of the
    Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company and this, with the stock held by
    friends, secured Selkirk a controlling interest in the Company.
    He then asked and secured from the directors
    160,000 square miles of territory in Manitoba on certain
    conditions of settlement. In 1811 about ninety persons
    from Scotland and Ireland reached York Factory, Hudson
    Bay, where they wintered, and in the spring of 1812 continued
    their journey, arriving at Red River in August of
    that year. This date marks the commencement of the
    settlement of the North West. From year to year settlers
    continued to arrive but all eked out a miserable existence
    until the North West Territory was taken over by the
    Dominion Government in 1870.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Seneca</span>: township in Haldimand county, Ontario,
    organized in 1835.</p>
<p>It took its name from one of the six Indian nations
    that made up the Iroquois Confederacy. The Senecas
    guarded the western end of the league in the vicinity of
    the Great Lakes. Seneca is said to be a corruption of <i>Sonontowane</i> meaning &ldquo;great mountain&rdquo;. It may be of
    Algonquin origin from their word <i>sinako</i> meaning
    &ldquo;mountain snakes&rdquo;, showing contempt for their enemy.
    Some writers think the present spelling of the word is
    due to its resemblance in sound to the name of the Roman
    orator Seneca.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Seul (lac)</span>: lake, Kenora and Patricia districts,
    Ontario.</p>
<p>The words are French and mean &ldquo;lonely lake&rdquo;. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span> Peter Pond&rsquo;s map of 1784 this body of water is called
    &ldquo;lake Alone&rdquo;. Its isolation suggested the name.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Seven Sisters</span>: falls on the Winnipeg River, Manitoba,
    possessing potential electric power of great value. Sir
    W. F. Butler in his tale of travel, <i>The Great Lone Land</i>,
    1870, states there are twenty-seven falls on this river and
    that it descends 360 feet in a distance of 160 miles. The
    Seven Sisters have a total fall of sixty feet in three miles.
    All the falls in this group are much alike in every particular,
    hence the name.</p>
<p>Seven Sisters is also the name of an historic group of
    majestic Douglas pines in Stanley Park, Vancouver, B.C.</p>
<p>See Wordsworth&rsquo;s poem, &ldquo;The Seven Sisters&rdquo;. It may
    have suggested the name.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Seymour</span>: township in Northumberland county,
    Ontario, organized in 1798.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Lady Elizabeth Seymour,
    daughter of the Duke of Somerset, and wife of Hugh
    Smithson who was raised to the peerage as Duke of
    Northumberland.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Shawanaga</span>: township in Parry Sound district, organized
    in 1877. It is the name of a small tribe of Indians
    to whom the Federal Government gave land along the
    Shawanaga bay and river in the district in 1877. The
    word Shawanaga is a corruption of <i>Shahwahnegah</i> which
    means &ldquo;a long bay&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Shawinigan</span>: lake and river, affluent of the St. Maurice
    River, Quebec. There is much controversy over the meaning
    of this word. Some Indian scholars derive it from
    Cree <i>shabonigan</i> (Algonquin dialect) meaning &ldquo;a portage
    shaped like a beech-nut&rdquo;; others maintain the word means
    &ldquo;the eye of a needle&rdquo; in allusion to the foamy water flowing
    between rocky shores, suggesting white thread passing
    through the eye of a needle. Shawinigan Falls is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span> town on the St. Maurice, the site of important electric
    power development.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Shebandowan</span>: lake in Thunder Bay district, Ontario.</p>
<p>The word is Indian, meaning &ldquo;long wigwam, having a
    door at each end&rdquo;. It is said to refer to a special tent
    that the aborigines used to erect for a dancing ceremony.
    It was put up in the spring from willows and poplars
    woven into a frame which was covered with skins. The
    Shebandowan was quite long and the guests danced the full
    length, returning on the outside to the front again.</p>
<p>The length and contour of the lake suggesting a ceremonial
    hall, the water was given its name.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Shepody</span>: a bay, an arm of Chignecto Bay, southern
    coast of New Brunswick.</p>
<p>The name is commonly said to be a corruption of the
    French phrase <i>Chapeau de Dieu</i>, &ldquo;hat of God&rdquo;. Ganong
    says this is wrong. He derives it from Micmac Indian <i>Es-ed-a-bit</i>, but gives no signification.</p>
<p>It is probable that Shepody and Shediac have a similar
    or at least allied, origin, both being derived from Micmac
    Indian <i>esedaik</i> meaning &ldquo;deep bay, an inlet that runs far
    back&rdquo;.</p>
<p>On records of 1686 the name is written Chigpondy,
    later, Chepodi, Chipondi. The Morris map of 1749 is the
    first to write it Shepody.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Sherborne</span>: township in Haliburton district, Ontario,
    surveyed in 1862. It was named after Sherborne, Dorsetshire,
    England, where Thomas Ridout was born. Sherbourne
    Street, Toronto, has the same origin. See <i>Ridout</i>.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Sherbrooke</span>: county and city in Quebec; townships,
    North and South, in Lanark county, Ontario, organized in
    1820; and township in Haldimand county, Ontario, organized
    in 1825.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>
<p>They were all named in honour of Sir John Coape
    Sherbrooke, 1764-1830, Governor-General of Canada,
    1816-&rsquo;18. His name is also retained in the fine residential
    street of Sherbrooke in Montreal.</p>
<p>Sherbrooke was one of Wellington&rsquo;s generals. He had
    given his country twenty-five years of military service
    before coming to Canada. Impaired health compelled him
    to resign after two years of civil administration distinguished
    by equal and impartial justice. Kingsford in his <i>History of Canada</i> writes:</p>
<div class="blockquot">
    <p>&ldquo;He has left behind him the impress of one of the wisest and
        ablest governors who held office before the establishment of responsible
        government.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p><span class="bold">Sherwood</span>: township in Renfrew county, Ontario,
    erected in 1862.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Judge Henry Sherwood, a
    son of Levins Sherwood whose uncle, Thomas Sherwood,
    was the first settler in the county of Leeds, where he
    arrived from Connecticut in 1784.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Shick-shock</span>: mountains, Gaspé county, Quebec.</p>
<p>The meaning of this word, according to John Mason
    Clarke, in his story of Gaspesia, entitled <i>The Heart of
    Gaspé</i>, is as follows:</p>
<div class="blockquot">
    <p>&ldquo;The Micmac word from which Shick-shock is derived means
        rocky mountains; they are the mountains to which Champlain
        applied the name Notre Dame. . . .&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p><span class="bold">Shippigan</span>: island, village, and harbour, Gloucester
    county, N.B.</p>
<p>The name was applied first to the narrow passage
    between the island and mainland. It is Micmac Indian,
    meaning &ldquo;duck road&rdquo;. This water-way was much frequented
    by wild ducks.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Shubenacadie</span>: river, lake, and village in Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>The word is derived from Micmac Indian <i>Segubuna-akade</i>,
    &ldquo;where nuts grow in abundance&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Sidney</span>: township in Hastings county, Ontario, organized
    in 1787.</p>
<p>It was named after Thomas Townshend, Viscount
    Sydney, 1732-1800, who was Secretary of State in the
    British Government at this period. Sydney, a city in
    Nova Scotia, has the same origin.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Sillery</span>: village and parish in Quebec county, about
    four miles south-west of Quebec city. The village occupies
    the site of an old Huron village.</p>
<p>It is named in honour of M. Noel de Sillery, a principal
    member of the One Hundred Associates formed by
    Richelieu in 1627. Before coming to New France he had
    played a considerable part in the political affairs of
    France, but eschewed temporal matters in the New World
    and expended his fortune in founding and maintaining a
    charitable institution at this point for the education and
    christianizing of Indian children.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Simcoe</span>: county, lake, and county-town of Norfolk
    county, all in Ontario.</p>
<p>They were named in honour of Lieut.-General John
    Graves Simcoe, first Lieut.-Governor of Upper Canada
    from 1791 to 1796. He established the seat of government
    at Newark (Niagara) in 1792 but moved it to York (Toronto)
    the next year. Eventually, in his opinion, London
    would be the best site for Upper Canada&rsquo;s permanent
    capital. Simcoe was zealous, active, and honest in the
    discharge of his duties as he saw them.</p>
<p>Toronto commemorates its founder&rsquo;s name in Simcoe
    Street, John Street, and Simcoe Hall, the administrative
    building of the University of Toronto. The provincial
    Government has erected a fine statue of Simcoe, executed
    by Canada&rsquo;s famous sculptor, Walter S. Allward, in
    Queen&rsquo;s Park, Toronto.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Simpson</span>: pass and river in British Columbia, lake and
    mountains in Yukon Territory, island (Great Slave Lake)
    and Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company post in McKenzie Territory.</p>
<p>They were named in commemoration of Sir George
    Simpson (1792-1860), Governor of Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company,
    1822-&rsquo;60. He was the first Governor in Chief of the
    reorganized Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company after it had absorbed
    the North West Company. Simpson possessed undoubted
    ability and great energy. Under his management the
    Company&rsquo;s business prospered, but there was now no
    rival and its hand was heavy and of iron.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Sinclair</span>: township in Muskoka district, Ontario,
    organized in 1876.</p>
<p>It took its name from Donald Sinclair, M.P.P. for
    North Bruce from 1867 to 1883, when he was appointed
    Registrar of Deeds for Bruce county.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Sir Alexander</span>: mount in the Cariboo district, British
    Columbia.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Sir Alexander Mackenzie,
    1755-1820, who crossed the Rocky Mountains near here
    in 1793.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Sir Donald</span>: mount, over 10,000 feet, a glacier, and a
    range of mountains in the Selkirks, B.C.</p>
<p>They were named in 1885 by an Order in Council after
    Sir Donald A. Smith, Lord Strathcona.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Sir Douglas</span>: mount, 11,174 feet, Alberta and British
    Columbia.</p>
<p>It was named after the late Sir Douglas Haig, Earl
    Haig of Bemersyde, Commander-in-chief of the British
    armies in France during the later years of the Great War,
    1914-1918.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Skeena</span>: river in B.C.</p>
<p>It is derived from Indian <i>iksh</i>, meaning &ldquo;out of&rdquo;, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span> <i>shean</i> or <i>shyen</i>, &ldquo;the clouds&rdquo;, indicating the source of the
    river.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Slave</span>: Great Slave is the name of a lake in the North
    West Territories and of a river in North West Territories
    and Alberta. Lesser Slave is the name of a lake and a
    river in Alberta.</p>
<p>When the Cree Indians defeated and plundered the
    Etchareotine and Thlingchadinne or Dogrib Indians and
    drove them north they nicknamed them Awokanak, that
    is &ldquo;slaves&rdquo;, and the name became attached to the waters
    of these tribes&rsquo; new home.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Smith</span>: township in Peterborough county, Ontario,
    erected in 1821.</p>
<p>The origin of the name is uncertain. The government
    of Upper Canada was administered for several years
    about this period by Hon. Samuel Smith, a U.E. Loyalist
    and a man of ability and character. It is probable that
    the township was named in his honour.</p>
<p>Sir David William Smith was Surveyor-General of
    Upper Canada and member of the Canadian Parliament
    for a good many years during the first quarter of the
    nineteenth century. He died in England in 1837.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Smith-Dorrien</span>: mount, 10,300 feet, in the Rockies,
    Alberta.</p>
<p>It was named after General Sir H. L. Smith-Dorrien,
    in command of the Second British army in France,
    1914-&rsquo;15. This gallant soldier died in 1930.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Smith&rsquo;s Falls</span>: large town on Rideau Canal, Lanark
    county, Ontario. It is an important railway (C.N.R. and
    C.P.R.), manufacturing and commercial centre.</p>
<p>The town owes its name to an enterprising Canadian
    who built a mill here in the early days of settlement on a
    waterfall of the Rideau, the site of which is now occupied
    by canal locks.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Smuts</span>: mount, 9,600 feet, in Alberta.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of General Jan Christian
    Smuts, a distinguished soldier and statesman of British
    South Africa.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Snellgrove</span>: charming village in Peel county, Ontario.</p>
<p>It was formerly called Edmonton after the English
    town of that name, but when Edmonton, Alberta, became
    a prosperous post the confusion in mail matter led to the
    present designation. The Snell family whom the modern
    name honours was one of the first settlers among a fine
    band of immigrants from Britain who located in this
    fertile district. See <i>Edmonton</i>.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Snowdon</span>: township in Haliburton district, Ontario,
    organized in 1858.</p>
<p>It took its name from Snowdon, the most lofty mountain
    of Wales. The poet Gray has immortalized the name
    in &ldquo;The Bard&rdquo; whose recitative falls on the ears of
    Edward I., the Conqueror of Wales:</p>
<div class="poem">

<p><span class="bold">Sombra</span>: township in Essex county, Ontario, instituted
    in 1822.</p>
<p>Sombra is Spanish for &ldquo;shade&rdquo; and is another instance
    of Sir Peregrine Maitland&rsquo;s familiarity with Spanish
    terms from his military service in the Peninsular War
    before becoming Lieut.-Governor of Upper Canada, 1818-&rsquo;28.
    This township was reserved for the Shawanese
    Indians, so loyal to British interests, and was, doubtless,
    wooded or shaded long after the adjacent townships were
    settled by tillers of the soil.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Sophiasburg</span>: township in Prince Edward county,
    Ontario, organized in 1788.</p>
<p>It was named after the Princess Sophia, a daughter
    of King George III., 1777-1848. She was delicate in health,
    never married, and was beloved for her good qualities.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Sorel</span>: city in Richelieu county, Quebec.</p>
<p>In 1661 Pierre de Saurel, captain in the regiment de
    Carignan, superintended the building of Fort Richelieu
    here. In 1672 Saurel or Sorel received a grant of land in
    this district and the town was named after him.</p>
<p>In 1787 the name was changed to William Henry in
    honour of Prince William Henry, later King William IV.,
    who landed at that village in September of that year.
    Sorel was never quite disused and ultimately displaced the
    Royal name.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Soulanges</span>: county in Quebec.</p>
<p>Pierre de Joybert who was granted a seigneury in this
    district, called it after the seigneury of Soulanges, Vitry,
    Champagne province, France, of which he had been the
    proprietor.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Souris</span>: river, affluent of Assiniboine, Sask. and Man.;
    a town in Man.; and a town in P.E.I.</p>
<p>The word is French meaning &ldquo;mouse&rdquo;. Plagues of
    mice were experienced in these districts in former years.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Southwold</span>: township in Elgin county Ontario, erected
    in 1792.</p>
<p>It took its name from Southwold in Suffolk, England.
    Southwold is Anglo-Saxon in origin, <i>wold</i> or <i>weald</i> meaning
    &ldquo;an open country&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Recently (1930) the Federal Government has acquired
    five acres of land in this township for a national park.
    It includes the Southwold Earthworks of three and one-half
    acres, unique in its class, being the only existing
    remains of a double-walled Indian fort on the continent.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Spence</span>: township in Parry Sound district, Ontario,
    surveyed in 1871.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Hon. Robert Spence, M.P.
    for Wentworth (North) and a Cabinet Minister of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span> Coalition Government from 1854-&rsquo;58. Later he became Collector
    of Customs at Toronto.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Spencerville</span>: picturesque and historic village in
    Grenville county, Ontario.</p>
<p>The village was named after the Spencer family who
    settled here about the year 1800. Peleg Spencer was
    granted by the Crown 200 acres of land for himself, and
    200 acres for each of his four sons. David, the eldest son,
    received the land on which Spencerville now stands.
    Information received from Mrs. Fairbairn (now eighty-eight
    years old), a daughter of George Spencer, youngest
    son of Peleg.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Spencer Wood</span>: the official residence of the Lieut.-Governor
    of the province of Quebec. It is situated on the
    north shore of the River St. Lawrence, just west of
    Wolfe&rsquo;s Cove, about two miles above the city of Quebec.</p>
<p>This sylvan retreat was owned from 1780 to 1796 by
    General Henry Watson Powell who named it Powell Place.
    In 1811 Michael Henry Perceval purchased it from
    Francis Le Houiller and renamed the estate Spencer
    Wood in honour of his relative and patron Hon. Spencer
    Perceval, Chancellor of the Exchequer and Prime Minister
    of England. In 1833 the property&mdash;originally over
    100 acres in extent&mdash;passed to Henry Atkinson who sold,
    about 1850, the larger part of it to the Government of
    Canada for a Governor&rsquo;s residence, retaining the smaller
    part for himself under the name, Spencer Grange. Later
    the Grange became the residence of Sir James Le Moine,
    the distinguished historian and litterateur, and Spencer
    Wood was acquired by the province of Quebec in 1870
    from the Dominion Government on condition that it be
    used only for the official residence of its Lieut.-Governor.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Sproule</span>: township in Nipissing district, Ontario,
    formed in 1889.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>
<p>It was named after Charles H. Sproule who became
    Provincial Auditor of Ontario in 1886.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Stadacona</span>: was the name of the Algonquin Indian
    village which Cartier visited in 1535 on the ground now
    occupied by part of the city of Quebec. The name is preserved
    in one of the wards of the city.</p>
<p>Lafleche and Ferland derive the word from the Algonquin
    term <i>statakwan</i>, meaning &ldquo;a wing&rdquo;, the angle
    formed by the meeting of the St. Charles River with the
    St. Lawrence having the conformation of a bird&rsquo;s wing.</p>
<p>Arnaud and Lacasse say the word is a corruption of
    the Montagnais <i>Statakosnen</i>, meaning &ldquo;the place where
    they pass on a collection of logs as on a bridge&rdquo;. It is
    said that in the days before the coming of the French the
    current of the river brought down fallen trees which
    jammed at this point so that the Indians could pass over
    them, back and forwards, from the mouth of the St.
    Charles to Sillery, to hunt and fish.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Stafford</span>: township in Renfrew county, Ontario,
    organized in 1843.</p>
<p>It took its name from Staffordshire, England, the
    home shire of Sir Charles Bagot, Governor-General of
    Canada, 1842-&rsquo;43.</p>
<p>Stafford town is said to get its name from the river
    Low being so shallow there that it could be forded by
    means of a staff.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Stamford</span>: township in Welland county, Ontario,
    organized in 1793.</p>
<p>The name was suggested by Lieut.-Governor Simcoe,
    1791-&rsquo;96, after Stamford, Lincolnshire, England. The English
    town took its name from a stone bridge or road across
    the Welland River at this point. The Anglo-Saxon form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span> was Stanford or Staenford, of which Stamford is a corruption.
    Stan is the Anglo-Saxon form of modern stone.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Stanhope</span>: township in Haliburton district, Ontario,
    surveyed in 1860.</p>
<p>It was named after Philip Henry Stanhope, fifth Earl
    of Stanhope, a British parliamentarian and writer of historical
    works of the period.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Stanley</span>: township in Huron county, Ontario, organized
    in 1830.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Edward Geoffrey Smith
    Stanley, fourteenth Earl of Derby, 1799-1869. He was a
    distinguished member of the British parliament and for a
    time Premier. His second son, Lord Stanley of Preston,
    was Governor-General of Canada, 1888-&rsquo;93. Stanley Park,
    City of Vancouver, is named in the Governor&rsquo;s honour.
    It consists of 950 acres bordering on the Pacific Ocean,
    and is the largest and most picturesque of all Canada&rsquo;s
    civic parks. This area was originally a Dominion Government
    Military Reserve. On the 1st of November, 1908,
    the Minister of Militia and Defence leased Stanley Park
    to the City of Vancouver for ninety-nine years, renewable.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Stayner</span>: town in Simcoe county, Ontario.</p>
<p>The town&rsquo;s first post office was opened on September
    1st, 1855, under the name of Nottawasaga Station. The
    Ontario, Simcoe and Huron Railway, the first of any
    importance in Canada, was opened from Toronto to
    Aurora, March 16, 1853, and completed to Collingwood on
    January 1, 1855. The railway authorities established a
    station at this point in 1854 and since the Nottawasaga
    Valley was near by, Nottawasaga Station was an appropriate
    name.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>
<p>However the name proved somewhat awkward for a
    post office centre in time on account of its length, and it
    was changed by the Federal Post Office Department to
    Stayner, November 1st, 1862. It was named Stayner
    after Mr. Sutherland Stayner who was the owner at that
    time of a large tract of land in the vicinity. He was the
    son of Mr. T. W. Stayner who was deputy Postmaster-General
    for Canada (an Imperial appointment) from
    April 6, 1828 to April 6, 1851, when the Post Office
    Department was transferred to the provincial authorities.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Stephen</span>: township in Huron county, Ontario, erected
    in 1835.</p>
<p>It took its name from James Stephen, Under Secretary
    for the Colonies in the British Government at this time.
    His views about the system of Government that should
    prevail in Canada were liberal, so much so that Sir
    Francis Bond Head described him in 1837 as a rank
    republican.</p>
<p>Stephen is also the name of a mount, 10,485 feet, Yoho
    Park, B.C. It was named in honour of Sir George
    Stephen, first president Canadian Pacific Railway, 1881-&rsquo;88.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Stephenson</span>: township in Muskoka district, Ontario,
    surveyed and named in 1862.</p>
<p>It was so called in honour of Robert Stephenson, Civil
    Engineer, 1803-&rsquo;59, who designed the Victoria Bridge over
    the St. Lawrence River at Montreal. His father, George
    Stephenson, invented the first locomotive in 1814. It
    operated a train between Stockton and Darlington, England.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Stikine</span>: river, Cassiar district, B.C., thence by way of
    the Alaskan riband into the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>The name is Indian meaning &ldquo;great river&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Stisted</span>: township in Muskoka district, Ontario, organized
    in 1869.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Major-General Henry
    William Stisted who acted as Lieut.-Governor, or
    Administrator, of Ontario from July, 1867, to July, 1868.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Stormont</span>: county in Ontario, bordering on the St.
    Lawrence River, organized in 1792.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of David Murray, seventh
    Viscount Stormont and second Earl of Mansfield, 1727-&rsquo;96.
    He was a distinguished British lawyer and statesman, at
    one time Secretary of State.</p>
<p>The title of Stormont was taken from the picturesque
    district of Stormont in Perthshire, Scotland. The family
    residence is called Scone Palace, near the city of Perth. It
    occupies the site of the ancient castle of the Kings of Scotland.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Storrington</span>: township in Frontenac county, Ontario,
    formed in 1845.</p>
<p>It took its name from the village of Storrington,
    Sussex, England, from which came the mother of Sir
    Henry Smith who represented Frontenac in the Legislative
    Assembly for a good many years.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Stouffville</span>: village in Ontario county, Ontario,
    incorporated in 1877.</p>
<p>It was named after Abraham Stouffer (or Stauffer)
    who moved here from Pennsylvania about the year 1806
    and bought the 200 acres on which the south half of the
    village is built. Abraham Stouffer was the great-great-grandfather
    of my informant, Mr. Archie Stouffer, principal
    of the Continuation School of the village.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Stratford</span>: city in Perth county, Ontario, so named by
    the Canada Company in 1831.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>
<p>It took its name from Stratford-on-Avon, England,
    the birthplace of one of the immortals of literature,
    William Shakespeare. Stratford is derived from Saxon&mdash;Latin <i>straeta</i>, <i>strata</i>, meaning &ldquo;a road or street&rdquo; and <i>ford</i>, the ford of the Avon on the stone highway, that is
    Watling Street built by the Romans from the fortified port
    of Richborough to Chester.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Strathroy</span>: town in Middlesex county, Ontario.</p>
<p>The name is derived from the Gaelic, <i>strathan</i>, &ldquo;a
    valley&rdquo;, and <i>ruadh</i>, &ldquo;reddish&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Stratton</span>: township in Nipissing district, Ontario,
    erected in 1893.</p>
<p>It was named after James R. Stratton, M.P.P. for
    West Peterborough for many years in the last quarter of
    the nineteenth century.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Streetsville</span>: charming village in Peel county, Ontario.</p>
<p>It was founded by the late Timothy Street and named
    in his honour. The village was incorporated in 1857.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Sudbury</span>: city and district in Northern Ontario.
    Near the city is the largest nickel mine in the world.
    Canada supplies ninety per cent. of the total world production
    of nickel, New Caledonia, an island east of
    Australia and belonging to France; Germany, France,
    Norway and Hungary the remaining ten per cent.</p>
<p>The name was given to the town by James Worthington,
    Superintendent of Construction on the C.P.R. main
    line in the winter of 1882-&rsquo;83. Mr. Worthington named the
    place after Sudbury, Suffolk, England, the birthplace of
    his wife. The word is derived from old English, <i>Suth beri</i> meaning &ldquo;south burg or fort&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The word nickel has an interesting origin. Among the
    first discoverers of this metal were the German miners
    of old. Its hardness and the difficulty they experienced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span> in smelting it led them to associate the metal with &ldquo;Old
    Nick&rdquo;, the vulgar name for the devil. So nickel is derived
    from low German <i>nikker</i> meaning &ldquo;devil&rdquo;, and <i>el</i>, diminutive&mdash;signifying
    &ldquo;a little devil&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Sullivan</span>: township in Grey county, Ontario, organized
    in 1840.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Hon. Robert Baldwin
    Sullivan who was born in Ireland and came to York, Canada,
    in 1834. He studied law and was appointed a member
    of the Executive Council of Upper Canada by Sir
    Francis Bond Head, Lieut.-Governor. In 1848 Mr. Sullivan
    was appointed a Judge of the Queen&rsquo;s Bench. He
    discharged with distinction the duties of this high office
    until his death in 1853.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Sunbury</span>: midland county of New Brunswick.</p>
<p>It was named after the parish and town of Sunbury
    on the Thames River, Middlesex county, England.</p>
<p>The name is derived from old English <i>sunna</i> meaning
    &ldquo;the sun&rdquo; and <i>burgh</i>, &ldquo;castle&rdquo;, the castle of the sun. In
    Doomsday Book the word is written &ldquo;Suneberie&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Sunnidale</span>: township in Simcoe county, Ontario,
    organized in 1823.</p>
<p>It is supposed to have received the name from the
    bright, sunny aspect of its landscape.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Sutton</span>: incorporated village situated on Lake Simcoe
    in York county, Ontario. It is a favourite summer resort.</p>
<p>Its name was taken from Sutton in Surrey, England.
    The word occurs in the Doomsday Book as Suthdun, that
    is &ldquo;south fort or town&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Sutton is also the name of a village in Brome county,
    Quebec, and in St. John county, N.B.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Swansea</span>: village on the western confines of the city
    of Toronto.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>
<p>It took its name from Swansea, Wales. The word is
    Danish, derived from <i>Sweynsei</i>, meaning &ldquo;the isle or land
    of King Sweyn&rdquo; who reigned over England, 1013-&rsquo;14.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Sydenham</span>: township in Grey county, Ontario, erected
    in 1842; a river in the same county; a river in Kent
    county, and a village in Frontenac county, Ontario.</p>
<p>They were named in honour of Charles Poulett Thomson,
    Lord Sydenham, who was Governor-General of Canada
    from 1839 until his death in 1841. He successfully
    inaugurated the union of Upper and Lower Canada.</p>
<p>Kingsford in his <i>History of Canada</i> states that Sydenham
    overcame all difficulties &ldquo;owing to the tact and judgment
    he displayed and the confidence he caused men to
    feel personally in him. The success of the union is Lord
    Sydenham&rsquo;s epitaph.&rdquo; He had chosen Kingston for the
    capital of Canada and here he died and his body was
    interred on the 24th of September, 1841, beneath the floor
    of St. George&rsquo;s Church in that city.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Tadoussac</span>: chief town of the county of Saguenay,
    Quebec, situated on the north-east side of the river
    Saguenay near its entrance into the St. Lawrence.</p>
<p>The word is derived from the Montagnais Indian term, <i>tutushits</i>, meaning &ldquo;teat, nipple&rdquo;. The name is descriptive
    of the situation of the town with regard to its
    environs.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Takakkaw</span>: falls on the Yoho River, Kootenay district,
    B.C.</p>
<p>The word is Indian, meaning &ldquo;magnificent&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Tantramar</span>: tidal river in New Brunswick, emptying
    into Cumberland Basin; and also the rich marsh lands
    along its banks.</p>
<p>The word is a corruption of the French <i>tintamarre</i>,
    meaning &ldquo;a thundering noise&rdquo;. It has generally been
    considered the name was applied on account of the noise
    made by the rush of the tide, but later students of the
    origin of the term think it referred to the noise of the
    great flocks of wild ducks and geese which frequent the
    marshes of the river.</p>
<p>The dyked lands, some 75,000 acres, of the Tantramar
    produce great quantities of timothy and clover hay.
    Much of its scenery is picturesque and inspiring. One of
    Canada&rsquo;s pre-eminent writers, Charles G. D. Roberts, is
    reported in the Press recently to have said that his mentality
    was largely formed by his father and the Tantramar.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Tavistock</span>: thriving village in Perth county, Ontario.</p>
<p>The first settler here was Henry Eckstein who opened
    an hotel in 1846 and named the place Freiburg after his
    native city in Bavaria. A post-office was opened about
    1849 under the name Tavistock, given by the Canadian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span> Post Office Department. It was named, no doubt, after
    Tavistock, a parish and a town in South Devon, England.
    The town is picturesquely situated in the valley of the
    Tavy River.</p>
<p>The word Tavistock is derived from Tavy and old
    English <i>stoc</i> meaning &ldquo;a place&rdquo;, Tavy stoc passed into
    Tavistock. Tavy is old English meaning &ldquo;still, silent&rdquo;, a
    characteristic of this river.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Tay</span>: township in Simcoe county, Ontario, instituted
    in 1822.</p>
<p>It took its name from one of Lady Sarah Maitland&rsquo;s
    three pet dogs. Lady Sarah was the wife of Sir Peregrine
    Maitland, Lieut.-Governor of Upper Canada, 1818-&rsquo;28.
    She was the daughter of Charles Lennox, fourth
    Duke of Richmond, Governor-General of Canada from
    1818 till his death from hydrophobia, caused by a bite
    from a tame fox, in 1819.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Tecumseh</span>: township in Simcoe county, Ontario,
    organized in 1822.</p>
<p>It is named in honour of Tecumseh, the Shawanoe
    chief, who fell fighting on the side of the British at
    Moraviantown in 1814. Tecumseh is also the name of a
    charming town near Windsor, Essex county, Ontario.</p>
<p>The Indians did not give their children permanent
    names in infancy. They waited until the youth or maiden
    manifested dominant qualities or characteristics and then
    gave a name in keeping therewith. Te-cum-seh is said to
    signify in English &ldquo;a tiger crouching for its prey&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This great chief is generally conceded to have been the
    bravest and most humane soldier, the wisest counsellor,
    and the most eloquent statesman of his race. From his
    youth he set his face steadily against the torturing or
    killing of captives and prisoners. His conception and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span> formation of a union or confederacy of all the Indian
    tribes to protect themselves against the encroachments
    of the whites is without a parallel. Tecumseh&rsquo;s speeches
    that have been preserved are extraordinarily logical and
    graphical. See his addresses before Harrison in the
    Council of Old Vincennes and before Proctor and his
    officers in the council held before the British retreat from
    Detroit in 1814, in Gurd&rsquo;s <i>Story of Tecumseh</i>.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Teeswater</span>: town on a branch of the Saugeen River in
    Bruce county, Ontario.</p>
<p>It takes its name from the Tees River and bay between
    Yorkshire and the county of Durham, England.</p>
<p>The word Tees is probably of Pre-Celtic origin. It
    may be from Welsh <i>tesack</i>, &ldquo;wantonness&rdquo;, a derivative of <i>tes</i> meaning &ldquo;heat of the sun&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Temiscouata</span>: county and large lake in north-eastern
    Quebec.</p>
<p>The county took its name from the lake which is Malecite
    Indian, meaning &ldquo;deep lake forming the source of a
    river&rdquo;, <i>temig</i>, &ldquo;deep&rdquo; and <i>esgoateg</i>, &ldquo;lake forming the
    source of a river&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Temiskaming</span>: great lake, an enlargement of the
    Ottawa River, on the frontier between Ontario and Quebec.</p>
<p>It is Algonquin Indian derived from <i>timi</i>, &ldquo;deep&rdquo; and <i>skami</i>, &ldquo;a great extension of water where the current in
    a river is very slow&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Thames</span>: river in Ontario, emptying into Lake St.
    Clair. It is named after the Thames in England.</p>
<p>The word Thames is of Celtic origin. An old form of
    the word is Tamesis, derived from the root word <i>tam</i> meaning &ldquo;quiet, still&rdquo;, which is descriptive of the Thames
    water.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>
<p>Thamesville is a town on the Thames River in Kent
    county, Ontario.</p>
<p><span class="bold">The Pas</span>: enterprising town on the banks of the Pas
    and Saskatchewan Rivers in northern Manitoba. The site
    was selected and laid out by the Dominion Government
    when the province was enlarged in 1905.</p>
<p>The origin of the name is disputed. Some derive it
    from Cree Indian, <i>opasquiaow</i>, &ldquo;water converging to a
    narrows with high land and spruce trees on either side&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Others think the term is French, Le Pas, meaning &ldquo;the
    gateway&rdquo; or &ldquo;narrow passage&rdquo; leading to the northland.</p>
<p>The younger Verendryes discovered the Saskatchewan
    River in 1741 and explored it from its mouth to the forks.
    Tradition says they named it Rivière du Pas in honour of
    their mother, Marie Anne Dandonneau du Pas. Some
    writers favour this origin.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Thessalon</span>: river and beautifully situated town in
    Algoma district, Ontario.</p>
<p>A few farm settlers were attracted here by the fertile
    soil in the sixties of last century, but the town was founded
    in the seventies by Dyment and May. Mr. N. Dyment
    of Barrie was the leading spirit in establishing a lumbering
    industry on this site.</p>
<p>With regard to the origin of the name Mr. J. B. Dobie
    writes me as follows: &ldquo;The town of Thessalon was named
    for Thessalon River which flows through the town into
    Lake Huron. The town is on a peninsula through which
    the river flows. On the west side of the river a narrow
    point juts out for one-half mile, and as this is approached
    by water from east or west it looks as though it were
    leaning over the water, and the Jesuit Fathers named it
    &ldquo;leaning point&rdquo; which sounds in French like Thessalon.
    This was told me by a Frenchman sixty years ago, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span> was confirmed by a surveyor who was doing survey work
    here in the early history of the district.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="bold">Thetford</span>: thriving town and township in Megantic
    county, Quebec. In this district are the richest asbestos
    mines in the world and they form the total Canadian output.
    They were named after the town and borough of
    Thetford in Norfolk, England. The town is situated on
    the Little Ouse River at the influx of the Thet.</p>
<p>The name Thetford is derived from Old English <i>theod</i> and <i>ford</i> meaning &ldquo;the ford of the people&rdquo;, that is a large
    wide ford.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Thompson</span>: affluent of the Fraser River, B.C.</p>
<p>It was named by Simon Fraser in honour of David
    Thompson (1770-1857), trader, astronomer, pathfinder
    and map-maker, Canada&rsquo;s prince of geographers and
    explorers from the St. Lawrence to the Pacific.</p>
<p>He gave thirteen years of service to the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay
    Company and fifteen years to the North West Company of
    which he was a partner. Thompson died in poverty and
    obscurity in Montreal and was buried in Mount Royal
    Cemetery. His grave remained unmarked for seventy
    years. On May 23, 1927, the Historical Association of
    Canada unveiled a fitting monument in his honour over
    his remains.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Thorah</span>: township in Ontario county, Ontario, erected
    in 1820.</p>
<p>The word is Hebrew, meaning the Pentateuch or first
    five books of the Old Testament in which the will of God
    is revealed to Moses.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Thorold</span>: town and township in Welland county,
    Ontario, organized in 1788.</p>
<p>They were named after Sir John Thorold, M.P.
    (1734-1815), who represented Lincolnshire in the British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span> House of Commons at this period. He opposed the war
    with the American colonies and voted against the Canada
    Bill (Constitutional Act of 1791).</p>
<p><span class="bold">Three Rivers</span> (Trois-Rivières): city in St. Maurice
    county, Quebec, situated at the entrance to the St. Maurice
    River which discharges its waters into the St. Lawrence
    by three mouths.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Thunder</span>: cape, bay, and district in Northern Ontario.</p>
<p>The bay was called by the aborigines <i>Animikie
    wekwed</i>, meaning &ldquo;Thunder Bird Bay&rdquo;. In folk-lore the
    thunder bird (imaginary) is the personification or cause
    of thunder common in the legends of many primitive
    peoples.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
    <p>&ldquo;We had rather foggy, dull weather on our way up to Lake
        Superior and after passing Thunder Cape (which is over twelve
        hundred feet high), and getting into Thunder Bay, we had a
        thunder storm which for grandeur I never expect to see surpassed&mdash;the
        vivid flashes of lightning lighting up the mountains on each
        side of us and showing the black waves with their white caps
        around us on every side; then from all sides of us ribbons of fire
        ran up the sky in all shapes, more like rockets and fireworks, whilst
        the thunder leaped from mountain to mountain in a continued roar,
        like nothing I ever heard before, and followed by a low growl.
        The lightning I suppose is attracted by the mineral deposits all
        around Thunder Bay. Certainly the whole locality is well named.
        If I were an artist I would choose Thunder Bay in a storm as the
        grandest representation of the end of the world. I could not help
        fancying when I looked over the side of the vessel that I would see
        old Charon launch his boat from the foot of Thunder Cape. Thunder
        Bay would be a magnificent Styx.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="bold">Thurlow</span>: township in Hastings county, Ontario,
    instituted in 1787.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Edward Thurlow (1732-1806),
    an English statesman. He entered parliament in
    1768 and became in turn Solicitor-General, Attorney-General,
    and Lord Chancellor in 1778, when he was raised
    to the peerage as Baron Thurlow.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Thurso</span>: village, Ottawa county, Quebec.</p>
<p>The place took its name from Thurso, town and river,
    Caithness, Scotland, which is derived from Old Norse, <i>Thorsaa</i>, meaning &ldquo;Thor&rsquo;s river&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Tignish</span>: river, pond, village, western terminus of the
    Prince Edward Island division of the C.N.R. The name
    is a corruption of the Micmac Indian word <i>mtagunich</i>,
    meaning &ldquo;a paddle&rdquo;, in allusion presumably to the outline
    of the river and pond. Dr. Rand suggests &ldquo;the tacking
    place&rdquo;, that is, where the course is changed.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Tilbury</span>: village and outport of Kent county, Ontario.
    Tilbury East, is a township in Kent county, organized in
    1794; and Tilbury West, is a township in Essex county,
    Ontario, organized in 1792.</p>
<p>The name was taken from the old fort of Tilbury near
    the mouth of the English Thames. Tilbury is the port of
    the London of to-day. Bede wrote this word Tilaburg,
    that is &ldquo;Tila&rsquo;s castle or burg&rdquo;. The first part of the word
    is probably pre-Celtic, meaning &ldquo;unknown&rdquo;, likely the
    name of a man.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Tillsonburg</span>: prosperous and progressive town in
    Oxford county, Ontario.</p>
<p>It took its name from the Tillson family who settled
    here in 1825, coming from Norfolk, England.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Timagami</span>: lake in Nipissing district, Ontario.</p>
<p>The term is Algonquin Indian meaning &ldquo;deep water&rdquo;,
    derived from <i>timi</i>, &ldquo;deep&rdquo; and <i>gama</i> or <i>gami</i>, a termination
    or suffix meaning &ldquo;lake&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Timmins</span>: town in the Temiskaming district, Northern
    Ontario.</p>
<p>It is named after Noah A. Timmins, President of the
    Hollinger Consolidated Gold Mine, Ltd., and one of the
    chief stockholders in the Company. The Hollinger is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span> richest producing gold mine in the Western Hemisphere.
    This mine claim was staked in 1909 by one Hollinger and
    sold to the Timmins associated interests in 1911 for
    $330,000. Up to the end of 1925 it had paid over
    $30,000,000 in dividends.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Tiny</span>: township in Simcoe county, Ontario, organized

<p><span class="bold">Tiverton</span>: village in Bruce county, Ontario.</p>
<p>There is a village called Tiverton in Devon and also in
    Cheshire, England. The word is a corruption of Twyford
    and -ton, that is &ldquo;two-ford-town&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Toledo</span>: charming village in Leeds county, Ontario.</p>
<p>It took its name from an historical city on the Tagus
    River, central Spain. About the time the village was
    founded the Spanish town was much in evidence in British
    military history. The War with France (1793-1815) led
    to the Peninsular Campaign (1809-&rsquo;13) in which Toledo
    was held by French armies for several years. It was in
    and around Toledo that Sir Andrew Keith Hay, a British
    officer, author of <i>A Narrative of the Peninsular War</i> performed
    amazing exploits while reconnoitring the enemy.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Torbolton</span>: township in Carleton county, Ontario, surveyed

    Settrington and Methuen of Torbolton. It is a village in
    Ayrshire, Scotland.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Toronto</span>: the capital of Ontario, and of a township in
    Peel county, Ontario, organized in 1806, and of Toronto
    Gore township in the same county, formed in 1819.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>
<p>The city of Toronto was founded in 1793 by Lieut.-Governor
    Simcoe of Upper Canada under the name of
    York. This name was given in honour of Frederick, Duke
    of York, second son of King George III., who was commander
    of a British army that won a victory in conjunction
    with the Austrians in this year over the French
    armies in Flanders. When York was incorporated as a
    city in 1834 its name was changed to Toronto.</p>
<p>The word Toronto is stated by nearly all authorities
    to be of Iroquois Indian origin but its meaning is disputed.</p>
<p>Dr. Hough, an Indian scholar of the United States,
    derives the word from Iroquois <i>Thoron-to-hen</i>, meaning
    &ldquo;timber (fallen trees) in the water&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Dr. L. H. Morgan, an American student of the Iroquois
    language, traces Toronto to <i>De-on-do</i> which he translates
    by &ldquo;logs floating on the water&rdquo;; a common sight, doubtless,
    on the bay before the advent of the whites.</p>
<p>General John S. Clark of Auburn, N.Y., who
    contributed an exhaustive study of the word Toronto to
    the Ontario Archaeological Report of 1899, holds that the
    foregoing derivations are erroneous. He thinks the word
    is a contraction of a compound formed from Seneca <i>Kanitare</i>, &ldquo;lake&rdquo;, and <i>onto</i>, &ldquo;to open&rdquo;, that is the opening
    or gateway from Lake Ontario to the country of the
    Hurons. Toronto Bay was but the entrance to the route
    which continued by Toronto River (now Humber) and
    Lake Toronto (now Simcoe). See copy of a French map
    of 1680 in Lizars&rsquo; <i>The Story of the Humber</i>, the original
    of which is in the Quebec Seminary.</p>
<p>Dr. Scadding in his <i>Toronto of Old</i> derives the word
    Toronto from the Huron language with the meaning of
    &ldquo;much, many&rdquo;. It was their name for the meeting-place,
    the populous region of native tribes, bordering on Lake
    Simcoe. The name became attached to the landing-place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span> of parties on the shore of Ontario who were on their way
    to the Huron country to hunt or trade, the starting place
    gradually taking the name of the goal.</p>
<p>Some writers maintain Toronto means &ldquo;a place of
    plenty&rdquo;, a signification allied to that given by Dr.
    Scadding. They state the Hurons applied the term from
    which Toronto is derived to any body of water where
    ducks and fish were plentiful.</p>
<p>Another signification is &ldquo;trees-rising-out-of-the-water&rdquo;,
    willows on The Island sighted from canoes, which
    seems to be mere guesswork from a Mohawk word of
    fancied resemblance.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Tosorontio</span>: township in Simcoe county, Ontario,
    erected in 1822.</p>
<p>Its origin is somewhat uncertain. One writer states it
    is Huron Indian meaning &ldquo;beautiful mountain&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Tottenham</span>: incorporated village in Simcoe county,
    Ontario.</p>
<p>Mr. J. W. Totten informs me that he distinctly remembers
    a public meeting being called, when he was ten or
    twelve years of age, to consider some matters relating to
    the opening of a post-office at this centre and that a very
    highly respected citizen, Mr. Nicholas Eagan, who was
    present, suggested that the name be Tottenham after a
    place he had known in the old land and in honour of Mr.
    Alexander Totten who had been largely instrumental
    in securing a post-office for the community.</p>
<p>Tottenham in England is a district of London. In
    Doomsday Book it is written Toteham. The word is
    derived from old English <i>Tota</i> or <i>Totta</i> and <i>ham</i>, &ldquo;home&rdquo;,
    meaning &ldquo;the home of Tota&rdquo;, a spy, lookout or tout
    ensconced on a hill.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Townsend</span>: township in Norfolk county, Ontario,
    organized in 1792.</p>
<p>It took its name from Thomas Townsend, Baron
    Sydney, (1732-1800), who was Secretary of State in the
    British Cabinet about this period. General Townsend
    who was present at the capture of Quebec, 1759, was of
    this family.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Tracadie</span>: village in Gloucester county, N.B., and bay
    and settlement in Prince Edward Island.</p>
<p>The word is a corruption of the Micmac Indian name, <i>Tulakadik</i>, meaning &ldquo;camping ground&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Trafalgar</span>: township in Halton county, Ontario,
    erected in 1806.</p>
<p>It took its name from Cape Trafalgar, coast of Cadiz,
    Spain. It was near this cape that the British fleet under
    Nelson defeated the combined fleets of France and Spain
    on October 21, 1805. See <i>Nelson</i>.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Trenton</span>: town on the bay of Quinte, Hastings county,
    Ontario.</p>
<p>It is situated at the mouth of the River Trent, named
    after the River Trent in England. By reversion the place <i>on the Trent</i> became Trenton, or according to some
    writers Trent town was shortened into Trenton.</p>

    the name of Vancouver.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Vankleek Hill</span>: town in Prescott county, Ontario,
    incorporated in 1897. It is picturesque in situation,
    occupying the highest portion of a ridge of land.</p>
<p>The town gets its name from its first settler, Simeon
    Van Kleek, a U.E. Loyalist from Duchess county, New
    York State.</p>
<p>At the close of the Revolutionary War in 1783, he with
    his family followed the British army to Nova Scotia.
    From there he moved to Argenteuil county, Quebec, in
    1798, where he had been given a grant of land by the
    Government. Seeing the high ridge on the south side of
    the Ottawa River, Mr. Van Kleek crossed over and
    secured several lots for himself and son in the township of
    West Hawkesbury, including the site of the town.</p>

<p>It takes its name from an English family but from
    which member it is uncertain. Gardiner in <i>Nothing but
    Names</i> states it was named after Benjamin Vaughan
    who with Richard Oswald negotiated the Treaty of Peace
    with the United States in 1783. Dr. Scadding suggested
    the fourth Viscount Vaughan, Earl of Lisburne, who
    appears to have been a soldier of some distinction at this
    period.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Verchères</span>: county and village in Quebec, south shore
    of St. Lawrence, about twenty miles east of Montreal.</p>
<p>They are named after Captain Verchères of the
    famous Carignan Regiment of French soldiers raised by
    Prince Carignan for service against hostile Indians in
    Canada. This regiment, the first to serve in New France,
    arrived at Quebec in 1665. On the completion of his term
    of service Verchères was granted a seigneury here. In
    his absence in 1692 the Fort of the settlement was valiantly
    defended against an Indian attack by half-a-dozen
    persons under the leadership of his daughter Madeleine.
    The story is one of the most thrilling in our history.</p>
<p>Recently a statue of Madeleine, some thirty feet high,
    has been erected on the spot where the Fort stood, overlooking
    the St. Lawrence. It was designed and executed
    by the eminent sculptor, Philippe Hébert.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Wallaceburg</span>: picturesque and historic town in Kent
    county, Ontario.</p>
<p>In all probability, the old settlers state, it was named
    in honour of the great champion of Scottish independence&mdash;Sir
    William Wallace. The pioneers of this famous
    &ldquo;Baldoon&rdquo; community were brought out by Lord Selkirk
    from the Hebrides. The place was known at first as &ldquo;The
    Forks&rdquo; owing to the fact that the north and east branches
    of the Sydenham River unite here. When the Forks began
    to assume the proportions of a town it was given the
    name of Wallaceburg by the descendants of the hardy
    settlers from Western Scotland.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Wallbridge</span>: township in Parry Sound district,

<p><span class="bold">Walpole</span>: township in Haldimand county, Ontario,
    erected in 1792.</p>
<p>It was probably named after Sir Robert Walpole,
    1676-1745, who was Premier of Great Britain for twenty
    years. Historians generally state that bribery was the
    secret of his long reign.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Warwick</span>: township in Lambton county, Ontario,
    organized in 1834.</p>
<p>It took its name from Warwick county, England.
    Warwick Castle is famed in story and is still a fine baronial
    residence. The word is derived from the Anglo-Saxon <i>wick</i>, meaning &ldquo;a station&rdquo; and war, that is &ldquo;a great
    stronghold in war&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Wasaga</span>: beach and community, Nottawasaga Bay,
    Simcoe county, Ontario.</p>
<p>This word is derived from Nottawasaga by the omission
    of the first two syllables, and Nottawasaga is from
    the Algonquin Indian <i>Nahdowa</i> or <i>Nodway</i>, signifying
    &ldquo;Iroquois&rdquo; and <i>saga</i>, &ldquo;outlet of river&rdquo;, that is, the outlet
    of the river by which the Iroquois came to attack the
    Algonquins. The name was applied in the first instance
    to the mouth of the river.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Washago</span>: post village in Simcoe county, Ontario, at
    the outlet of Lake Couchiching, twelve miles north of
    Orillia.</p>

    cause over the French army under Napoleon on
    June 18, 1815.</p>
<p>Waterloo is derived from Anglo-Saxon <i>waeter</i>,
    &ldquo;water&rdquo;, and <i>leah</i> (lea), the Flemish form of which is <i>loo</i>,
    &ldquo;a meadow&rdquo;, that is, &ldquo;the meadow by the water&rdquo;.</p>

    miles west of London.</p>
<p>The place was named after the town of Watford, in
    Hertfordshire, England, on the River Colne, fifteen miles
    north-west of London.</p>
<p>In 1853 the late Richard Brown, Esquire, settled in the
    Township of Warwick at a place then called Brown&rsquo;s
    Corners, where Watford now is located, opening a small
    store. In 1854 he was appointed postmaster by the
    Postmaster-General, Hon. Malcolm Cameron. On
    being asked by Mr. Cameron to suggest a name for the
    new post-office, Mr. Brown replied that he had just received
    a letter dated at Watford, England, from a friend,
    and if the Honourable Gentleman thought it fit he might
    apply that name, which was accordingly adopted. This
    information was received from the courteous Town Clerk,
    Mr. W. S. Fuller.</p>
<p>The word, Watford, was derived from Wat or Wata,
    and ford, that is, &ldquo;Wat&rsquo;s ford on the river Colne&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Watt</span>: township in Muskoka district, Ontario, organized

    county, Ontario.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>
<p>The word is Algonquin Indian, <i>waubau</i>, &ldquo;narrows&rdquo;,
    and <i>shene</i>, &ldquo;the place of&rdquo;. Here is the narrowest channel
    of the bay. Another English translation is &ldquo;the meeting
    of the rocks&rdquo;. Both significations embody the same idea.</p>

    of this tribe.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Webbwood</span>: town in Sudbury district, Ontario. It
    was founded in 1875 and incorporated in 1907.</p>
<p>The town was named after Andrew Webb, one of the
    original settlers.</p>
<p>The principal industry of Webbwood, as its name
    indicates, was lumbering until about five years ago when,
    the timber being exhausted, the people turned to mining.
    Some rich veins of gold have been uncovered a few miles
    north of the town.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Welland</span>: county in Ontario, formed in 1849, and its

    (wells).</p>
<p><span class="bold">Wellesley</span>: township in Waterloo county, Ontario,

    organized in 1851.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of William Wilberforce, an
    English statesman and philanthropist. It was largely
    through his efforts that the Emancipation Act of 1833
    was passed by the British Parliament. By this Act
    slavery was abolished in all British Dominions. The
    slave-holders were granted £20,000,000 as compensation,
    and eight hundred thousand slaves were set free in 1838,
    after giving five years of apprenticeship to prepare
    them for freedom, and to enable the planters to meet the
    new conditions.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Wilkes</span>: township in Nipissing district, Ontario, surveyed
    in 1881.</p>
<p>It was named after Alfred John Wilkes, Q.C., of the
    law firm of Hardy, Wilkes and Hardy, Brantford, the
    senior partner of which was Hon. A. S. Hardy, for many
    years a prominent member and Minister of the Ontario
    Legislature, becoming Premier shortly before his death.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Williams</span>: township in Middlesex county, Ontario,
    instituted in 1830.</p>
<p>Williams Township, East and West, was named after
    William Williams, M.P., Deputy Governor of the Canada
    Land Company at this period.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Williamsburg</span>: township in Dundas county, Ontario,
    erected in 1787.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Prince William Henry,
    third son of King George III., 1765-1839. At the age of
    fourteen he became a midshipman on a man-of-war. In
    1811 at the age of forty-six he had risen to be Admiral of
    the fleet. The sailor Prince became King William IV. in
    1830. It has been written of him that he &ldquo;walked in
    London streets with his umbrella under his arm, frankly
    shook hands with old acquaintances, and was a favourite
    with the people&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Williamstown</span>: historic and picturesque village on the
    River Raisin in Glengarry county, Ontario. Along the
    banks of this river, wild grapes grew in abundance and
    for this reason the French voyageurs named it &ldquo;Rivière
    aux Raisins&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This settlement was founded by Sir John Johnson who
    was granted a tract of land here by King George III. He
    called the place Williamstown in honour of his father,
    Sir William Johnson. Both gave distinguished service in
    aid of the lost cause of the U.E. Loyalists.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>
<p>In early days several men who achieved notable
    distinction had their homes in this town. Among them
    were Simon Fraser, David Thompson and Sir Alexander
    Mackenzie, each of whose names are forever embalmed
    in the nomenclature of great rivers of Canada.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Wilmot</span>: township in Waterloo county, Ontario,
    organized in 1825.</p>
<p>The origin of the name is uncertain. It may have been
    named after Major Samuel Street Wilmot of U.E.L. descent
    who took part in the war of 1812. He was a surveyor
    and surveyed many of the townships of Upper
    Canada.</p>
<p>A Mr. R. J. Wilmot was Secretary for the Colonies in
    the British Government at this period and favoured the
    sale of the Clergy Reserve Lands to the Canada Company.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Willoughby</span>: township in Welland county, Ontario,
    erected in 1787.</p>
<p>The origin of the name is uncertain. There are seven
    villages in England bearing this name, three of them
    in Lincolnshire.</p>
<p>The word is derived from old English <i>welig</i> or <i>wilig</i>,
    &ldquo;a willow&rdquo; and the Danish suffix <i>by</i>, &ldquo;a farm, a village&rdquo;,
    that is, &ldquo;the willow village&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Wilson</span>: township in Parry Sound district, Ontario,
    instituted in 1877.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Chief-Justice Sir Adam
    Wilson, 1814-&rsquo;91. He came to Toronto from Scotland in
    1830 and studied law in Hon. Robert Baldwin&rsquo;s office. In
    1859 Mr. Wilson was elected to the Canadian Assembly
    from North York and was Solicitor-General for a time
    before going on the Bench in 1863.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Winchester</span>: township in Dundas county, Ontario,
    erected in 1798; and a town in the same county.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>
<p>They took their name from the old town of Winchester
    in Hampshire, England, the capital in King Alfred the
    Great&rsquo;s reign.</p>
<p>The word is derived from old English <i>win</i>, &ldquo;a plain&rdquo;,
    and <i>caster</i> (Latin <i>castra</i>), &ldquo;a fort&rdquo;, that is, &ldquo;a fortified
    place in the open country&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Windham</span>: township in Norfolk county, Ontario,
    organized in 1792.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Hon. William Windham,
    1750-1810. He was member of the British Parliament for
    twenty-six years and Secretary of War and the Colonies
    for some time at this period. Mr. Windham was a statesman
    of the highest character, holding the deepest respect
    of his Sovereign and his country.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Windigo</span>: bay and islands, Lake Nipigon, Thunder
    Bay district; and lake and river, tributary to Severn
    River, Patricia district, Ontario; and also a tributary of
    the River St. Maurice, county of Champlain, Quebec.</p>
<p>Windigo is an Algonquin Indian word, meaning literally
    &ldquo;devil&rdquo;. According to the Indian superstition the
    wendigo is a giant cannibal some twenty to thirty feet
    high and Indians who have gone hunting and have never
    afterward been heard of, have been devoured by this
    monster. They believed that certain waters and districts
    were reserved by this semi-devil for his exclusive use and
    avoided them.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Windsor</span>: city in Essex county, Ontario, founded in
    1834. East Windsor, formerly the town of Ford City,
    Essex county, assumed full urban status in 1929.</p>
<p>It takes its name from Windsor, England. The word
    is derived from old English <i>Wyndelshore</i>, &ldquo;the shore of
    Wendel&rdquo;, the bank or locality of the Vandals, a fierce
    Teutonic tribe.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>
<p>Windsor is also the name of a town in Hants county,
    N.S., and in Richmond county, Quebec.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Winnipeg</span>: the capital city of Manitoba; and a lake in
    the same province. The city took its name from the lake.</p>
<p>The word is Cree Indian, derived from <i>win</i> meaning
    &ldquo;dirty&rdquo; and <i>nipi</i>, &ldquo;water&rdquo;.</p>
<p>An Indian legend ascribes the muddy character of the
    water of Lake Winnipeg to a deity who was taken captive
    by an elderly squaw and so besmeared by dirt that it took
    all the water of the lake to purify him, and by way of
    retaliation he has ever since busied himself keeping up the
    discoloration.</p>
<p>Fort Garry, a trading post of the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company,
    and so called after one of its officers, was the
    nucleus of the city of Winnipeg. The first house in the
    place is said to have been built in 1862. The post office
    was opened in 1870 under the name of Fort Garry and
    changed in 1876 to Winnipeg.</p>
<p>Lower Fort Garry was in the Selkirk Settlement
    twenty miles north of Upper Fort Garry (Winnipeg).</p>
<p><span class="bold">Winnipegosis</span>: is the name of a lake west of Lake
    Winnipeg.</p>
<p>The word is a diminutive of Winnipeg and means
    &ldquo;little muddy water&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Wolfe</span>: county in Quebec, and an island township in
    Frontenac county, Ontario, named in 1792.</p>
<p>They were named in honour of Major-General James
    Wolfe, a native of Westerham, Kent county, England,
    the victor in the historic battle of the Plains of Abraham
    before Quebec.</p>
<p>Wolfe died from his wounds on the field of battle.
    His body was taken to England on a war-ship. It rested
    in his mother&rsquo;s home in Westerham for one night and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span> then buried in the village church. A beautiful bronze
    tablet telling briefly the story of his life marks the place.
    Many Canadians visit the church annually to view his
    last resting-place. A striking statue to his memory is
    erected in Westminster Abbey.</p>
<p>Recently a fine memorial to General Wolfe has been
    erected in Greenwich Park, London, England, and on
    June 5th, 1930, it was unveiled by the Marquis of Montcalm,
    a direct descendant of the brave general, in the
    presence of a distinguished gathering of the Empire&rsquo;s
    sons. Thus did the marquis of to-day show his appreciation
    of the illustrious opponent of his heroic ancestor.
    This statue of the general was the gift of Canada and was
    designed by the famous Canadian sculptor, Dr. Tait
    McKenzie.</p>
<p>A memorial column erected by the victors on the
    Plains marks the spot where Wolfe fell and one hundred
    years ago the Governor-General of Canada unveiled a
    monument at Quebec bearing the inscription &ldquo;Wolfe&mdash;Montcalm.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="bold">Wolford</span>: township in Grenville county, Ontario,
    organized in 1797.</p>
<p>It took its name from a property belonging to Lieut.-Governor
    Simcoe in Devonshire, England. His residence
    there was known as Wolford Lodge. He was buried at
    his household chapel at Wolford. See <i>Simcoe</i>.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Wolfville</span> or Wolfeville: pleasant town in Nova Scotia,
    incorporated in 1893. It is situated close to Grand Pré,
    the centre of the &ldquo;Evangeline District&rdquo;. During the summer
    season it is the headquarters of tourists visiting this
    historic section of the Province. Wolfville is the seat of
    Acadia College, an institution of the Baptist Church, and
    the much loved <i>alma mater</i> of many professional Maritime
    men.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>
<p>The town was named in honour of its founders, a
    family by the name of De Wolfe, descendants of whom
    still reside there. They are said to be distant relatives of
    General James Wolfe, the leader of the British army in
    the Battle of the Plains of Abraham, 1759.</p>
<p>In recent years the &ldquo;e&rdquo; has been elided from Wolfeville,
    but it was retained by Haliburton in his <i>History of
    Nova Scotia</i> and by early map-makers.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Wollaston</span>: township in Hastings county, Ontario,
    erected in 1857.</p>
<p>It was named after Dr. William Hyde Wollaston,
    1766-1828, a celebrated chemist of London. He added to
    Dalton&rsquo;s &ldquo;Atoms theory&rdquo; and was honoured with the
    presidency of the Royal Society.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Wood</span>: township in Muskoka district, Ontario, organized
    in 1870.</p>
<p>It was named after Hon. Burke Wood, 1817-&rsquo;82. He
    was a member of the Canadian Assembly for South
    Brant, 1865-&rsquo;67. After Confederation Mr. Wood was
    elected to both the Ontario Legislature and the House of
    Commons. He held the office of Treasurer in Hon. John
    Sandfield Macdonald&rsquo;s government. In 1874 Mr. Wood
    was appointed Chief-Justice of Manitoba, which office he
    held until his death. He discharged all the duties of his
    several offices with distinction.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Woodhouse</span>: township in Norfolk county, Ontario,
    erected in 1792.</p>
<p>The origin of the name is not known. There are nine
    villages of the name of Woodhouse in England, but not
    one of them is in Norfolk.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Woods</span>: lake, south-west of Ontario, bordering on
    Manitoba and Minnesota. It is extremely irregular in
    shape and contains many islands. This lake collects the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span> waters of many rivers and discharges them by the
    Winnipeg River into Lake Winnipeg.</p>
<p>The first French explorers of this district found the
    islands of the lake so thickly covered with trees that they
    called it Lac des Bois, Lake of the Woods.</p>
<p>During the year 1736 one of the sons of the enthusiastic
    explorer, Pierre Gauthier de Varennes, Sieur de la
    Vérendrye, a Jesuit Priest named Père Aulneau and
    twenty companions and guides, were massacred on one
    of these islands by Sioux Indians. A memorial chapel
    has been erected on it to which the Geographic Board of
    Canada has given the name of Massacre Island.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Woodstock</span>: city in Oxford county, Ontario, founded
    in 1833; and also a town in Carleton county, New
    Brunswick.</p>
<p>They are both named after Woodstock, Oxfordshire,
    England.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Wooler</span>: pleasant and prosperous village of about 400
    people in the county of Northumberland, Ontario.</p>
<p>C. G. Ruttan, a pioneer who rode into this district on
    horseback seventy-eight years ago (1851) states that
    there was only one building then on the site of the present
    village. It was half hotel and half store. The place was
    then known as Smith&rsquo;s Corners. Mr. Ruttan built the
    first church when the number of people in the place had
    grown to about one hundred. Then the name was changed
    at the people&rsquo;s request to Wooler after Wooler in
    Northumberland county, England, from which some of
    the early settlers had come. Information from Mr. and
    Mrs. L. B. Scott of Wooler Post Office.</p>
<p>The word Wooler is derived from old English <i>Welloure</i> meaning &ldquo;well over the bank or edge&rdquo; of the River Till,
    an affluent of the Tweed, on which it is situated. Locally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span> the word Wooler is considered to mean a great wool
    market which the town is, but English place-names in
    Wool, seldom have any connection with the wool of
    commerce.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Woolwich</span>: township in Waterloo county, Ontario,
    organized in 1822.</p>
<p>It took its name from Woolwich, Kent, England, famed
    for its extensive naval arsenal and royal dockyard.</p>
<p>The word Woolwich is derived from Anglo-Saxon <i>wul</i>,
    &ldquo;wool&rdquo;, and <i>wich</i> meaning &ldquo;station, house, village&rdquo;, that is
    &ldquo;the village for wool&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Wroxeter</span>: town in Huron county, Ontario.</p>
<p>It is named after Wroxeter in Shropshire, England.</p>
<p>The word is derived from old English, <i>Wrocn&rsquo;s ceaster</i> &ldquo;Wrocn&rsquo;s camp&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Wylie</span>: township in Renfrew county, Ontario, instituted
    in 1864.</p>
<p>It was named in honour of Hon. James Wylie, sometime
    member of the Legislative Council of Canada before
    Confederation, 1867. Mr. Wylie came to Canada from
    Scotland about 1820 and engaged in the mercantile business
    in Ramsayville, now Almonte, Ontario.</p>
<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="Y" id="Y">Y</a></h2>
<p><span class="bold">Yale</span>: picturesque town situated on the Fraser River
    and county or district in southern British Columbia.</p>
<p>Fort Yale was founded by the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company
    in 1848 and named after a Mr. Yale, an efficient factor,
    in the employ of the Company in that district. The town
    and county were named in his honour.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Yamaska</span>: county, village and river in Quebec.</p>
<p>Lacombe and Lafleche derive the word from the Cree
    Indian <i>Igamaska</i>, meaning &ldquo;where the grass and rushes
    are high&rdquo;. R. P. Lemoine thinks it is Montagnais with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span> practically the same meaning. The word was, doubtless,
    applied first to the water by the Indians.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Yarmouth</span>: county and town in Nova Scotia, and
    township in Elgin county, Ontario, surveyed and named
    in 1792.</p>
<p>They take their name from the seaport of Yarmouth,
    Norfolkshire, England.</p>
<p>The word Yarmouth is derived from the mouth of the
    river Yare. <i>Yare</i> or <i>Yar</i> is Celtic, meaning &ldquo;rough&rdquo;. In
    Doomsday Book it is written <i>er</i>, the Gaelic form is <i>Garbh</i>.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Yellowhead</span>: the pass in the Rockies, Alberta and B.C.
    through which the Canadian National Railway crosses the
    mountains.</p>
<p>It was suggested by Tête Jaune, French for Yellowhead,
    a nickname of a trapper who used to cache his furs
    west of this pass. Malcolm McLeod states the trapper&rsquo;s
    name was Francois Decoigne, who was in charge of the
    Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company&rsquo;s post at Jasper, Brule Lake, in
    1814.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Yeovil</span>: village in Grey county, Ontario.</p>
<p>It is named after the borough of Yeovil in Somerset,
    England. The word is derived from yew and village, &ldquo;the
    yew village&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Yoho</span>: park, peak, glacier, river, lake and pass,
    Kootenay district, B.C.</p>
<p>The name is Cree Indian, meaning &ldquo;how wonderful!&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="bold">Yonge</span>: township in Leeds county, Ontario, organized
    in 1786, and also Toronto&rsquo;s great thoroughfare.</p>
<p>They were both named in honour of the Right Hon.
    Sir George Yonge. He was a personal friend of Lieut.-Governor
    Simcoe and Secretary of War in the British
    Government from 1782 to 1794. Sir George supported
    the Canada Bill or Constitutional Act of 1791. There is
    a portrait of this statesman in Read&rsquo;s <i>Life and Times of</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span> <i>General John Graves Simcoe</i>. It is taken from an
    engraved portrait after Mather Brown, in the possession
    of the Toronto Public Library.</p>
<p><span class="bold">York</span>: county in Ontario, and township in the same
    county, both organized in 1792.</p>
<p>They were named after Yorkshire in England.
    Original Celtic form was <i>Eborach</i>, <i>ebor</i> or <i>abar</i>, &ldquo;a
    marsh&rdquo;, and <i>ach</i>, &ldquo;place of&rdquo;, meaning &ldquo;a marshy or
    muddy place&rdquo;. The present form of York comes through
    the influence of Danes who called it <i>Jorvick</i>, the J being
    equivalent to Y. (Johnston&rsquo;s <i>Place Names of England
    and Wales</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="bold">Yukon</span>: territory and river in north-western Canada.</p>
<p>The word is Indian, meaning &ldquo;the river&rdquo;, that is, the
    greatest river, to which it was only applied in the first
    instance. The name Yukon was first given to this water
    by J. Bell of the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company in 1846.</p>
<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="Z" id="Z">Z</a></h2>
<p><span class="bold">Zone</span>: township in Kent county, Ontario, formed in
    1821.</p>
<p>The present area known by this name was cut off from
    Orford township to give a separate organization to the
    district or zone reserved for Moravian Indians.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Zorra</span>: East and West; famous township in Oxford
    county, Ontario, organized in 1819.</p>
<p>Zorra is the Spanish word for female fox, a crafty
    person. It was, doubtless, suggested by Lieut.-Governor
    Sir Peregrine Maitland, 1818-&rsquo;28, who gave military service
    in Spain under Wellington before receiving his
    appointment to Upper Canada.</p>
<p>Some do not take kindly to this derivation and prefer
    to think it was called after the Biblical Zorah, Judges
    xiii, 2.</p>
